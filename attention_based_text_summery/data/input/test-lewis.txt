have one more look inside it; for by this time she was beginning to wonder herself whether Narnia
and the Faun had not been a dream. The house was so large and complicated and full of hiding-places
that she thought she would have time to have one look into the wardrobe and then hide somewhere
else. But as soon as she reached it she heard steps in the passage outside, and then there was nothing
for it but to jump into the wardrobe and hold the door closed behind her. She did not shut it properly
because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe, even if it is not a magic one.
Now the steps she had heard were those of Edmund; and he came into the room just in time to see
Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He at once decided to get into it himself - not because he thought
it a particularly good place to hide but because he wanted to go on teasing her about her imaginary
country. He opened the door. There were the coats hanging up as usual, and a smell of mothballs, and
darkness and silence, and no sign of Lucy. "She thinks I'm Susan come to catch her," said Edmund to
himself, "and so she's keeping very quiet in at the back." He jumped in and shut the door, forgetting
what a very foolish thing this is to do. Then he began feeling about for Lucy in the dark. He had
expected to find her in a few seconds and was very surprised when he did not. He decided to open the
door again and let in some light. But he could not find the door either. He didn't like this at all and
began groping wildly in every direction; he even shouted out, "Lucy! Lu! Where are you? I know
you're here."
 There was no answer and Edmund noticed that his own voice had a curious sound - not the sound
you expect in a cupboard, but a kind of open-air sound. He also noticed that he was unexpectedly
cold; and then he saw a light.
"Thank goodness," said Edmund, "the door must have swung open of its own accord." He forgot all
about Lucy and went towards the light, which he thought was the open door of the wardrobe. But
instead of finding himself stepping out into the spare room he found himself stepping out from the
shadow of some thick dark fir trees into an open place in the middle of a wood.
There was crisp, dry snow under his feet and more snow lying on the branches of the trees.
Overhead there was pale blue sky, the sort of sky one sees on a fine winter day in the morning.
Straight ahead of him he saw between the tree-trunks the sun, just rising, very red and clear.
Everything was perfectly still, as if he were the only living creature in that country. There was not
even a robin or a squirrel among the trees, and the wood stretched as far as he could see in every
direction. He shivered.
He now remembered that he had been looking for Lucy; and also how unpleasant he had been to her
about her "imaginary country" which now turned out not to have been imaginary at all. He thought
that she must be somewhere quite close and so he shouted, "Lucy! Lucy! I'm here too-Edmund."
 There was no answer.
"She's angry about all the things I've been saying lately," thought Edmund. And though he did not
like to admit that he had been wrong, he also did not much like being alone in this strange, cold, quiet
place; so he shouted again.
"I say, Lu! I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I see now you were right all along. Do come out. Make it
Pax."
 Still there was no answer.
"Just like a girl," said Edmund to himself, "sulking somewhere, and won't accept an apology." He
looked round him again and decided he did not much like this place, and had almost made up his
mind to go home, when he heard, very far off in the wood, a sound of bells. He listened and the sound
came nearer and nearer and at last there swept into sight a sledge drawn by two reindeer.
The reindeer were about the size of Shetland ponies and their hair was so white that even the snow
hardly looked white compared with them; their branching horns were gilded and shone like
something on fire when the sunrise caught them. Their harness was of scarlet leather and covered
with bells. On the sledge, driving the reindeer, sat a fat dwarf who would have been about three feet
high if he had been standing. He was dressed in polar bear's fur and on his head he wore a red hood
with a long gold tassel hanging down from its point; his huge beard covered his knees and served him
instead of a rug. But behind him, on a much higher seat in the middle of the sledge sat a very
different person - a great lady, taller than any woman that Edmund had ever seen. She also was
covered in white fur up to her throat and held a long straight golden wand in her right hand and wore
a golden crown on her head. Her face was white - not merely pale, but white like snow or paper or
icing-sugar, except for her very red mouth. It was a beautiful face in other respects, but proud and
cold and stern.
The sledge was a fine sight as it came sweeping towards Edmund with the bells jingling and the
dwarf cracking his whip and the snow flying up on each side of it.
"Stop!" said the Lady, and the dwarf pulled the reindeer up so sharp that they almost sat down. Then
they recovered themselves and stood champing their bits and blowing. In the frosty air the breath
coming out of their nostrils looked like smoke.
"And what, pray, are you?" said the Lady, looking hard at Edmund.
"I'm-I'm-my name's Edmund," said Edmund rather awkwardly. He did not like the way she looked 
at him.
The Lady frowned, "Is that how you address a Queen?" she asked, looking sterner than ever.
"I beg your pardon, your Majesty, I didn't know," said Edmund:
 "Not know the Queen of Narnia?" cried she. "Ha! You shall know us better hereafter. But I repeatwhat
are you?"
 "Please, your Majesty," said Edmund, "I don't know what you mean. I'm at school - at least I was it's
the holidays now."
 "BUT what are you?" said the Queen again. "Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its
beard?"
 "No, your Majesty," said Edmund, "I never had a beard, I'm a boy."
 "A boy!" said she. "Do you mean you are a Son of Adam?"
 Edmund stood still, saying nothing. He was too confused by this time to understand what the
question meant.
"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be," said the Queen. "Answer me, once and for all, or 
I shall lose my patience. Are you human?"
 "Yes, your Majesty," said Edmund.
"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?"
 "Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe."
 "A wardrobe? What do you mean?"
 "I - I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty," said Edmund.
"Ha!" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. "A door. A door from the world of
men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with."
As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes
flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do
something dreadful but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she
appeared to change her mind.
"My poor child," she said in quite a different voice, "how cold you look! Come and sit with me here
on the sledge and I will put my mantle round you and we will talk."
 Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and
sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle round him and tucked it well in.
"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen. "Should you like that?"
 "Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.
The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small bottle which looked as if it
were made of copper. Then, holding out her arm, she let one drop fall from it on the snow beside the
sledge. Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid-air, shining like a diamond. But the moment it
touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that
steamed. The dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile; not a
very nice smile. Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink. It was something he had
never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.
"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," said the Queen presently. "What would you like
best to eat?"
 "Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty," said Edmund.
The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round
box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best
Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted
anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.
While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it
is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to
shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat,
and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he
had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a
Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about
Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them, and kept on coming
back to it. "You are sure there are just four of you?" she asked. "Two Sons of Adam and two
Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept
on saying, "Yes, I told you that before," and forgetting to call her "Your Majesty", but she didn't
seem to mind now.
At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box
and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew
quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted
Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would
even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him any
more. Instead, she said to him,
 "Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them
to see me?"
 "I'll try," said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.
"Because, if you did come again - bringing them with you of course - I'd be able to give you some
more Turkish Delight. I can't do it now, the magic will only work once. In my own house it would be
another matter."
 "Why can't we go to your house now?" said Edmund. When he had first got on to the sledge he had
been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be
able to get back; but he had forgotten about that fear now.
"It is a lovely place, my house," said the Queen. "I am sure you would like it. There are whole
rooms full of Turkish Delight, and what's more, I have no children of my own. I want a nice boy
whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone. While he was
Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long; and you are much the
cleverest and handsomest young man I've ever met. I think I would like to make you the Prince -
some day, when you bring the others to visit me."
 "Why not now?" said Edmund. His face had become very red and his mouth and fingers were sticky.
He did not look either clever or handsome, whatever the Queen might say.
"Oh, but if I took you there now," said she, "I shouldn't see your brother and your sisters. I very
much want to know your charming relations. You are to be the Prince and - later on - the King; that is
understood. But you must have courtiers and nobles. I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters
Duchesses."
 "There's nothing special about them," said Edmund, "and, anyway, I could always bring them some
other time."
 "Ah, but once you were in my house," said the Queen, "you might forget all about thern. You would
be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn't want the bother of going to fetch them. No. You must
go back to your own country now and come to me another day, with them, you understand. It is no 
good coming without them."
 "But I don't even know the way back to my own country," pleaded Edmund. "That's easy," answered
the Queen. "Do you see that lamp?" She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same
lamp-post under which Lucy had met the Faun. "Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the World of
Men. And now look the other way'- here she pointed in the opposite direction - "and tell me if you
can see two little hills rising above the trees."
 "I think I can," said Edmund.
"Well, my house is between those two hills. So next time you come you have only to find the lamppost
and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house. But remember -
you must bring the others with you. I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone."
 "I'll do my best," said Edmund.
"And, by the way," said the Queen, "you needn't tell them about me. It would be fun to keep it a
secret between us two, wouldn't it? Make it a surprise for them. Just bring them along to the two hills
- a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that - and when you come to my
house you could just say "Let's see who lives here" or something like that. I am sure that would be
best. If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may have heard strange stories about me - nasty
stories that might make her afraid to come to me. Fauns will say anything, you know, and now -"
 "Please, please," said Edmund suddenly, "please couldn't I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to
eat on the way home?"
 "No, no," said the Queen with a laugh, "you must wait till next time." While she spoke, she signalled
to the dwarf to drive on, but as the sledge swept away out of sight, the Queen waved to Edmund,
calling out, "Next time! Next time! Don't forget. Come soon."
 Edmund was still staring after the sledge when he heard someone calling his own name, and looking
round he saw Lucy coming towards him from another part of the wood.
"Oh, Edmund!" she cried. "So you've got in too! Isn't it wonderful, and now-"
 "All right," said Edmund, "I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all. I'll say I'm sorry
if you like. But where on earth have you been all this time? I've been looking for you everywhere."
 "If I'd known you had got in I'd have waited for you," said Lucy, who was too happy and excited to
notice how snappishly Edmund spoke or how flushed and strange his face was. "I've been having
lunch with dear Mr Tumnus, the Faun, and he's very well and the White Witch has done nothing to
him for letting me go, so he thinks she can't have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all
right after all."
 "The White Witch?" said Edmund; "who's she?"
 "She is a perfectly terrible person," said Lucy. "She calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has
no right to be queen at all, and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and Dwarfs and Animals - at
least all the good ones - simply hate her. And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of
horrible things. And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia - always winter, but it
never gets to Christmas. And she drives about on a sledge, drawn by reindeer, with her wand in her
hand and a crown on her head."
 Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweets, and when he heard
that the Lady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable. But
he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else.
"Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch?" he asked.
"Mr Tumnus, the Faun," said Lucy.
"You can't always believe what Fauns say," said Edmund, trying to sound as if he knew far more
about them than Lucy.
"Who said so?" asked Lucy.
"Everyone knows it," said Edmund; "ask anybody you like. But it's pretty poor sport standing here
in the snow. Let's go home."
 "Yes, let's," said Lucy. "Oh, Edmund, I am glad you've got in too. The others will have to believe in
Narnia now that both of us have been there. What fun it will be!"
 But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as for her. He would have to
admit that Lucy had been right, before all the others, and he felt sure the others would all be on the
side of the Fauns and the animals; but he was already more than half on the side of the Witch. He did
not know what he would say, or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about
Narnia.
By this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coats around them instead of
branches and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room.
"I say," said Lucy, "you do look awful, Edmund. Don't you feel well?"
 "I'm all right," said Edmund, but this was not true. He was feeling very sick.
"Come on then," said Lucy, "let's find the others. What a lot we shall have to tell them! And what
wonderful adventures we shall have now that we're all in it together."
 BECAUSE the game of hide-and-seek was still going on, it took Edmund and Lucy some time to 
find the others. But when at last they were all together (which happened in the long room, where the
suit of armour was) Lucy burst out:
 "Peter! Susan! It's all true. Edmund has seen it too. There is a country you can get to through the
wardrobe. Edmund and I both got in. We met one another in there, in the wood. Go on, Edmund; tell
them all about it."
 "What's all this about, Ed?" said Peter.
And now we come to one of the nastiest things in this story. Up to that moment Edmund had been
feeling sick, and sulky, and annoyed with Lucy for being right, but he hadn't made up his mind what
to do. When Peter suddenly asked him the question he decided all at once to do the meanest and most
spiteful thing he could think of. He decided to let Lucy down.
"Tell us, Ed," said Susan.
And Edmund gave a very superior look as if he were far older than Lucy (there was really only a
year's difference) and then a little snigger and said, "Oh, yes, Lucy and I have been playing -
pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true. just for fun, of course. There's
nothing there really."
 Poor Lucy gave Edmund one look and rushed out of the room.
Edmund, who was becoming a nastier person every minute, thought that he had scored a great
success, and went on at once to say, "There she goes again. What's the matter with her? That's the
worst of young kids, they always -"
 "Look here," said Peter, turning on him savagely, "shut up! You've been perfectly beastly to Lu ever
since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe, and now you go playing games with her about it
and setting her off again. I believe you did it simply out of spite."
 "But it's all nonsense," said Edmund, very taken aback.
"Of course it's all nonsense," said Peter, "that's just the point. Lu was perfectly all right when we left
home, but since we've been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning
into a most frightful liar. But whichever it is, what good do you think you'll do by jeering and
nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next?"
 "I thought - I thought," said Edmund; but he couldn't think of anything to say.
"You didn't think anything at all," said Peter; "it's just spite. You've always liked being beastly to
anyone smaller than yourself; we've seen that at school before now."
 "Do stop it," said Susan; "it won't make things any better having a row between you two. Let's go
and find Lucy."
 It was not surprising that when they found Lucy, a good deal later, everyone could see that she had
been crying. Nothing they could say to her made any difference. She stuck to her story and said:
 "I don't care what you think, and I don't care what you say. You can tell the Professor or you can
write to Mother or you can do anything you like. I know I've met a Faun in there and - I wish I'd
stayed there and you are all beasts, beasts."
 It was an unpleasant evening. Lucy was miserable and Edmund was beginning to feel that his plan
wasn't working as well as he had expected. The two older ones were really beginning to think that
Lucy was out of her mind. They stood in the passage talking about it in whispers long after she had
gone to bed.
The result was the next morning they decided that they really would go and tell the whole thing to
the Professor. "He'll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrong with Lu," said Peter;
"it's getting beyond us." So they went and knocked at the study door, and the Professor said "Come
in," and got up and found chairs for them and said he was quite at their disposal. Then he sat listening
to them with the tips of his fingers pressed together and never interrupting, till they had finished the
whole story. After that he said nothing for quite a long time. Then he cleared his throat and said the
last thing either of them expected:
 "How do you know," he asked, "that your sister's story is not true?"
 "Oh, but -" began Susan, and then stopped. Anyone could see from the old man's face that he was
perfectly serious. Then Susan pulled herself together and said, "But Edmund said they had only been
pretending."
 "That is a point," said the Professor, "which certainly deserves consideration; very careful
consideration. For instance - if you will excuse me for asking the question - does your experience
lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable? I mean, which is the more
truthful?"
 "That's just the funny thing about it, sir," said Peter. "Up till now, I'd have said Lucy every time."
 "And what do you think, my dear?" said the Professor, turning to Susan.
"Well," said Susan, "in general, I'd say the same as Peter, but this couldn't be true - all this about the
wood and the Faun."
 "That is more than I know," said the Professor, "and a charge of lying against someone whom you
have always found truthful is a very serious thing; a very serious thing indeed."
 "We were afraid it mightn't even be lying," said Susan; "we thought there might be something wrong
with Lucy."
 "Madness, you mean?" said the Professor quite coolly. "Oh, you can make your minds easy about
that. One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad."
 "But then," said Susan, and stopped. She had never dreamed that a grown-up would talk like the
Professor and didn't know what to think.
"Logic!" said the Professor half to himself. "Why don't they teach logic at these schools? There are
only three possibilities. Either your sister is telling lies, or she is mad, or she is telling the truth. You
know she doesn't tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad For the moment then and unless any
further evidence turns up, we must assume that she is telling the truth."
 Susan looked at him very hard and was quite sure from the expression on his face that he was no
making fun of them.
"But how could it be true, sir?" said Peter.
"Why do you say that?" asked the Professor.
"Well, for one thing," said Peter, "if it was true why doesn't everyone find this country every time
they go to the wardrobe? I mean, there was nothing there when we looked; even Lucy didn't pretend
the was."
 "What has that to do with it?" said the Professor.
"Well, sir, if things are real, they're there all the time."
 "Are they?" said the Professor; and Peter did'nt know quite what to say.
"But there was no time," said Susan. "Lucy had no time to have gone anywhere, even if there was
such a place. She came running after us the very moment we were out of the room. It was less than
minute, and she pretended to have been away for hours."
 "That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true," said the Professor. "If there really a
door in this house that leads to some other world (and I should warn you that this is a very strange
house, and even I know very little about it) - if, I say, she had got into another world, I should not be
at a surprised to find that the other world had a separate time of its own; so that however long you 
stay there it would never take up any of our time. On the other hand, I don't think many girls of her
age would invent that idea for themselves. If she had been pretending, she would have hidden for a
reasonable time before coming out and telling her story."
 "But do you really mean, sir," said Peter, "that there could be other worlds - all over the place, just
round the corner - like that?"
 "Nothing is more probable," said the Professor, taking off his spectacles and beginning to polish
them, while he muttered to himself, "I wonder what they do teach them at these schools."
 "But what are we to do?" said Susan. She felt that the conversation was beginning to get off the
point.
"My dear young lady," said the Professor, suddenly looking up with a very sharp expression at both
of them, "there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying."
 "What's that?" said Susan.
"We might all try minding our own business," said he. And that was the end of that conversation.
After this things were a good deal better for Lucy. Peter saw to it that Edmund stopped jeering at
her, and neither she nor anyone else felt inclined to talk about the wardrobe at all. It had become a
rather alarming subject. And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end;
but that was not to be.
This house of the Professor's - which even he knew so little about - was so old and famous that
people from all over England used to come and ask permission to see over it. It was the sort of house
that is mentioned in guide books and even in histories; and well it might be, for all manner of stories
were told about it, some of them even stranger than the one I am telling you now. And when parties
of sightseers arrived and asked to see the house, the Professor always gave them permission, and Mrs
Macready, the housekeeper, showed them round, telling them about the pictures and the armour, and
the rare books in the library. Mrs Macready was not fond of children, and did not like to be
interrupted when she was telling visitors all the things she knew. She had said to Susan and Peter
almost on the first morning (along with a good many other instructions), "And please remember 
you're to keep out of the way whenever I'm taking a party over the house."
 "Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange
grown-ups!" said Edmund, and the other three thought the same. That was how the adventures began
for the second time.
A few mornings later Peter and Edmund were looking at the suit of armour and wondering if they
could take it to bits when the two girls rushed into the room and said, "Look out! Here comes the
Macready and a whole gang with her."
 "Sharp's the word," said Peter, and all four made off through the door at the far end of the room. But
when they had got out into the Green Room and beyond it, into the Library, they suddenly heard
voices ahead of them, and realised that Mrs Macready must be bringing her party of sightseers up the
back stairs - instead of up the front stairs as they had expected. And after that - whether it was that
they lost their heads, or that Mrs Macready was trying to catch them, or that some magic in the house
had come to life and was chasing them into Narnia they seemed to find themselves being followed
everywhere, until at last Susan said, "Oh bother those trippers! Here - let's get into the Wardrobe
Room till they've passed. No one will follow us in there." But the moment they were inside they
heard the voices in the passage - and then someone fumbling at the door - and then they saw the
handle turning.
"Quick!" said Peter, "there's nowhere else," and flung open the wardrobe. All four of them bundled
inside it and sat there, panting, in the dark. Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for, of
course, he remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up
in a wardrobe.
 "I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away," said Susan presently, "I'm
getting horribly cramped."
 "And what a filthy smell of camphor!" said Edmund.
"I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it," said Susan, "to keep away the moths."
 "There's something sticking into my back," said Peter.
"And isn't it cold?" said Susan.
"Now that you mention it, it is cold," said Peter, "and hang it all, it's wet too. What's the matter with
this place? I'm sitting on something wet. It's getting wetter every minute." He struggled to his feet.
"Let's get out," said Edmund, "they've gone."
 "O-o-oh!" said Susan suddenly, and everyone asked her what was the matter.
"I'm sitting against a tree," said Susan, "and look! It's getting light - over there."
 "By Jove, you're right," said Peter, "and look there - and there. It's trees all round. And this wet stuff
is snow. Why, I do believe we've got into Lucy's wood after all."
 And now there was no mistaking it and all four children stood blinking in the daylight of a winter
day. Behind them were coats hanging on pegs, in front of them were snow-covered trees.
Peter turned at once to Lucy.
"I apologise for not believing you," he said, "I'm sorry. Will you shake hands?"
 "Of course," said Lucy, and did.
"And now," said Susan, "what do we do next?"
 "Do?" said Peter, "why, go and explore the wood, of course."
 "Ugh!" said Susan, stamping her feet, "it's pretty cold. What about putting on some of these coats?"
 "They're not ours," said Peter doubtfully.
"I am sure nobody would mind," said Susan; "it isn't as if we wanted to take them out of the house;
we shan't take them even out of the wardrobe."
 "I never thought of that, Su," said Peter. "Of course, now you put it that way, I see. No one could say
you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this
whole country is in the wardrobe."
 They immediately carried out Susan's very sensible plan. The coats were rather too big for them so
that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put
them on. But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new
get-up and more suitable to the landscape.
"We can pretend we are Arctic explorers," said Lucy.
"This is going to be exciting enough without pretending," said Peter, as he began leading the way
forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be
more snow before night.
"I say," began Edmund presently, "oughtn't we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are 
aiming for the lamp-post?" He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been
in the wood before. The moment the words were out of his mouth he realised that he had given
himself away. Everyone stopped; everyone stared at him. Peter whistled.
"So you really were here," he said, "that time Lu said she'd met you in here - and you made out she
was telling lies."
 There was a dead silence. "Well, of all the poisonous little beasts -" said Peter, and shrugged his
shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, no more to say, and presently the four resumed
their journey; but Edmund was saying to himself, "I'll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck-up,
selfsatisfied prigs."
 "Where are we going anyway?" said Susan, chiefly for the sake of changing the subject.
"I think Lu ought to be the leader," said Peter; "goodness knows she deserves it. Where will you
take us, Lu?"
 "What about going to see Mr Tumnus?" said Lucy. "He's the nice Faun I told you about."
 Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping their feet. Lucy proved a
good leader. At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way, but she recognised an
oddlooking tree on one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground
became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus's cave. But there a
terrible surprise awaited them.
The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, the cave was dark and cold
and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days. Snow had
drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which turned
out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had apparently flung it about the room
and then stamped it out. The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun's father
had been slashed into shreds with a knife.
"This is a pretty good wash-out," said Edmund; "not much good coming here."
 "What is this?" said Peter, stooping down. He had just noticed a piece of paper which had been
nailed through the carpet to the floor.
"Is there anything written on it?" asked Susan.
"Yes, I think there is," answered Peter, "but I can't read it in this light. Let's get out into the open
air."
 They all went out in the daylight and crowded round Peter as he read out the following words:
 The former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a
charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair
Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, etc., also of comforting her said Majesty's enemies, harbouring
spies and fraternizing with Humans.
signed MAUGRIM, Captain of the Secret Police, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN
 The children stared at each other.
"I don't know that I'm going to like this place after all," said Susan.
"Who is this Queen, Lu?" said Peter. "Do you know anything about her?"
 "She isn't a real queen at all," answered Lucy; "she's a horrible witch, the White Witch. Everyone all
the wood people - hate her. She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always
winter here and never Christmas."
 "I - I wonder if there's any point in going on," said Susan. "I mean, it doesn't seem particularly safe 
here and it looks as if it won't be much fun either. And it's getting colder every minute, and we've
brought nothing to eat. What about just going home?"
 "Oh, but we can't, we can't," said Lucy suddenly; "don't you see? We can't just go home, not after
this. It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble. He hid me from the Witch
and showed me the way back. That's what it means by comforting the Queen's enemies and
fraternizing with Humans. We simply must try to rescue him."
 "A lot we could do! said Edmund, "when we haven't even got anything to eat!"
 "Shut up - you!" said Peter, who was still very angry with Edmund. "What do you think, Susan?"
 "I've a horrid feeling that Lu is right," said Susan. "I don't want to go a step further and I wish we'd
never come. But I think we must try to do something for Mr Whatever-his-name is - I mean the
Faun."
 "That's what I feel too," said Peter. "I'm worried about having no food with us. I'd vote for going
back and getting something from the larder, only there doesn't seem to be any certainty of getting into
this country again when once you've got out of it. I think we'll have to go on."
 "So do I," said both the girls.
"If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned!" said Peter.
They were all still wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, "Look! There's a robin, with such a
red breast. It's the first bird I've seen here. I say! - I wonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks
as if it wanted to say something to us." Then she turned to the Robin and said, "Please, can you tell us
where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?" As she said this she took a step towards the bird. It at
once flew away but only as far as to the next tree. There it perched and looked at them very hard as if
it understood all they had been saying. Almost without noticing that they had done so, the four
children went a step or two nearer to it. At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once
more looked at them very hard. (You couldn't have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter
eye.)
 "Do you know," said Lucy, "I really believe he means us to follow him."
 "I've an idea he does," said Susan. "What do you think, Peter?"
 "Well, we might as well try it," answered Peter.
The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going from tree to tree, always a
few yards ahead of them, but always so near that they could easily follow it. In this way it led them
on, slightly downhill. Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch.
Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew
dazzlingly bright. They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in
front, when Edmund said to Peter, "if you're not still too high and mighty to talk to me, I've
something to say which you'd better listen to."
 "What is it?" asked Peter.
"Hush! Not so loud," said Edmund; "there's no good frightening the girls. But have you realised
what we're doing?"
 "What?" said Peter, lowering his voice to a whisper.
"We're following a guide we know nothing about. How do we know which side that bird is on? Why
shouldn't it be leading us into a trap?"
 "That's a nasty idea. Still - a robin, you know. They're good birds in all the stories I've ever read. I'm
sure a robin wouldn't be on the wrong side."
"It if comes to that, which is the right side? How do we know that the Fauns are in the right and the
Queen (yes, I know we've been told she's a witch) is in the wrong? We don't really know anything
about either."
 "The Faun saved Lucy."
 "He said he did. But how do we know? And there's another thing too. Has anyone the least idea of
the way home from here?"
 "Great Scott!" said Peter, "I hadn't thought of that."
 "And no chance of dinner either," said Edmund.
 WHILE the two boys were whispering behind, both the girls suddenly cried "Oh!" and stopped.
"The robin!" cried Lucy, "the robin. It's flown away." And so it had - right out of sight.
"And now what are we to do?" said Edmund, giving Peter a look which was as much as to say
"What did I tell you?"
 "Sh! Look!" said Susan.
"What?" said Peter.
"There's something moving among the trees over there to the left."
 They all stared as hard as they could, and no one felt very comfortable.
"There it goes again," said Susan presently.
"I saw it that time too," said Peter. "It's still there. It's just gone behind that big tree."
 "What is it?" asked Lucy, trying very hard not to sound nervous.
"Whatever it is," said Peter, "it's dodging us. It's something that doesn't want to be seen."
 "Let's go home," said Susan. And then, though nobody said it out loud, everyone suddenly realised
the same fact that Edmund had whispered to Peter at the end of the last chapter. They were lost.
"What's it like?" said Lucy.
"It's - it's a kind of animal," said Susan; and then, "Look! Look! Quick! There it is."
 They all saw it this time, a whiskered furry face which had looked out at them from behind a tree.
But this time it didn't immediately draw back. Instead, the animal put its paw against its mouth just as
humans put their finger on their lips when they are signalling to you to be quiet. Then it disappeared
again. The children, all stood holding their breath.
A moment later the stranger came out from behind the tree, glanced all round as if it were afraid
someone was watching, said "Hush", made signs to them to join it in the thicker bit of wood where it
was standing, and then once more disappeared.
"I know what it is," said Peter; "it's a beaver. I saw the tail."
 "It wants us to go to it," said Susan, "and it is warning us not to make a noise."
 "I know," said Peter. "The question is, are we to go to it or not? What do you think, Lu?"
 "I think it's a nice beaver," said Lucy.
"Yes, but how do we know?" said Edmund.
"Shan't we have to risk it?" said Susan. "I mean, it's no good just standing here and I feel I want
some dinner."
 At this moment the Beaver again popped its head out from behind the tree and beckoned earnestly to
them.
"Come on," said Peter,"let's give it a try. All keep close together. We ought to be a match for one
beaver if it turns out to be an enemy."
 So the children all got close together and walked up to the tree and in behind it, and there, sure
enough, they found the Beaver; but it still drew back, saying to them in a hoarse throaty whisper,
"Further in, come further in. Right in here. We're not safe in the open!"
 Only when it had led them into a dark spot where four trees grew so close together that their boughs
met and the brown earth and pine needles could be seen underfoot because no snow had been able to
fall there, did it begin to talk to them.
"Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve?" it said.
"We're some of them," said Peter.
"S-s-s-sh!" said the Beaver, "not so loud please. We're not safe even here."
 "Why, who are you afraid of?" said Peter. "There's no one here but ourselves."
 "There are the trees," said the Beaver. "They're always listening. Most of them are on our side, but
there are trees that would betray us to her; you know who I mean," and it nodded its head several
times.
"If it comes to talking about sides," said Edmund, "how do we know you're a friend?"
 "Not meaning to be rude, Mr Beaver," added Peter, "but you see, we're strangers."
 "Quite right, quite right," said the Beaver. "Here is my token." With these words it held up to them a
little white object. They all looked at it in surprise, till suddenly Lucy said, "Oh, of course. It's my
handkerchief - the one I gave to poor Mr Tumnus."
 "That's right," said the Beaver. "Poor fellow, he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened
and handed this over to me. He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take
you on to -" Here the Beaver's voice sank into silence and it gave one or two very mysterious nods.
Then signalling to the children to stand as close around it as they possibly could, so that their faces
were actually tickled by its whiskers, it added in a low whisper -
 "They say Aslan is on the move - perhaps has already landed."
 And now a very curious thing happened. None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than
you do; but the moment the Beaver had spoken these words everyone felt quite different. Perhaps it
has sometimes happened to you in a dream that someone says something which you don't understand
but in the dream it feels as if it had some enormous meaning - either a terrifying one which turns the
whole dream into a nightmare or else a lovely meaning too lovely to put into words, which makes the
dream so beautiful that you remember it all your life and are always wishing you could get into that
dream again. It was like that now. At the name of Aslan each one of the children felt something jump 
in its inside. Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror. Peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous.
Susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful strain of music had just floated by her. And
Lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realize that it is the beginning of
the holidays or the beginning of summer.
"And what about Mr Tumnus," said Lucy; "where is he?"
 "S-s-s-sh," said the Beaver, "not here. I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also
dinner."
 No one except Edmund felt any difficulty about trusting the beaver now, and everyone, including
Edmund, was very glad to hear the word "dinner".
They therefore all hurried along behind their new friend who led them at a surprisingly quick pace,
and always in the thickest parts of the forest, for over an hour. Everyone was feeling very tired and
very hungry when suddenly the trees began to get thinner in front of them and the ground to fall
steeply downhill. A minute later they came out under the open sky (the sun was still shining) and
found themselves looking down on a fine sight.
They were standing on the edge of a steep, narrow valley at the bottom of which ran - at least it
would have been running if it hadn't been frozen - a fairly large river. Just below them a dam had
been built across this river, and when they saw it everyone suddenly remembered that of course
beavers are always making dams and felt quite sure that Mr Beaver had made this one. They also
noticed that he now had a sort of modest expression on his, face - the sort of look people have when
you are visiting a garden they've made or reading a story they've written. So it was only common
politeness when Susan said, "What a lovely dam!" And Mr Beaver didn't say "Hush" this time but
"Merely a trifle! Merely a trifle! And it isn't really finished!"
 Above the dam there was what ought to have been a deep pool but was now, of course, a level floor
of dark green ice. And below the dam, much lower down, was more ice, but instead of being smooth
this was all frozen into the foamy and wavy shapes in which the water had been rushing along at the
very moment when the frost came. And where the water had been trickling over and spurting through
the dam there was now a glittering wall of icicles, as if the side of the dam had been covered all over
with flowers and wreaths and festoons of the purest sugar. And out in the middle, and partly on top of
the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof
smoke was going up, so that when you saw it {especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of
cooking and became hungrier than you were before.
That was what the others chiefly noticed, but Edmund noticed something else. A little lower down
the river there was another small river which came down another small valley to join it. And looking
up that valley, Edmund could see two small hills, and he was almost sure they were the two hills
which the White Witch had pointed out to him when he parted from her at the lamp-post that other
day. And then between them, he thought, must be her palace, only a mile off or less. And he thought
about Turkish Delight and about being a King ("And I wonder how Peter will like that?" he asked
himself) and horrible ideas came into his head.
"Here we are," said Mr Beaver, "and it looks as if Mrs Beaver is expecting us. I'll lead the way. But
be careful and don't slip."
 The top of the dam was wide enough to walk on, though not (for humans) a very nice place to walk
because it was covered with ice, and though the frozen pool was level with it on one side, there was a
nasty drop to the lower river on the other. Along this route Mr Beaver led them in single file right out
to the middle where they could look a long way up the river and a long way down it. And when they
had reached the middle they were at the door of the house.
"Here we are, Mrs Beaver," said Mr Beaver, "I've found them. Here are the Sons and Daughters of
Adam and Eve'- and they all went in.
The first thing Lucy noticed as she went in was a burring sound, and the first thing she saw was a
kindlooking old she-beaver sitting in the corner with a thread in her mouth working busily at her
sewing machine, and it was from it that the sound came. She stopped her work and got up as soon as
the children came in.
"So you've come at last!" she said, holding out both her wrinkled old paws. "At last! To think that
ever I should live to see this day! The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle's singing and I daresay,
Mr Beaver, you'll get us some fish."
 "That I will," said Mr Beaver, and he went out of the house (Peter went with him), and across the ice
of the deep pool to where he had a little hole in the ice which he kept open every day with his hatchet.
They took a pail with them. Mr Beaver sat down quietly at the edge of the hole (he didn't seem to
mind it being so chilly), looked hard into it, then suddenly shot in his paw, and before you could say
Jack Robinson had whisked out a beautiful trout. Then he did it all over again until they had a fine
catch of fish.
Meanwhile the girls were helping Mrs Beaver to fill the kettle and lay the table and cut the bread
and put the plates in the oven to heat and draw a huge jug of beer for Mr Beaver from a barrel which
stood in one corner of the house, and to put on the frying-pan and get the dripping hot. Lucy thought
the Beavers had a very snug little home though it was not at all like Mr Tumnus's cave. There were
no books or pictures, and instead of beds there were bunks, like on board ship, built into the wall.
And there were hams and strings of onions hanging from the roof, and against the walls were gum
boots and oilskins and hatchets and pairs of shears and spades and trowels and things for carrying
mortar in and fishing-rods and fishing-nets and sacks. And the cloth on the table, though very clean,
was very rough.
Just as the frying-pan was nicely hissing Peter and Mr Beaver came in with the fish which Mr
Beaver had already opened with his knife and cleaned out in the open air. You can think how good
the new-caught fish smelled while they were frying and how the hungry children longed for them to
be done and how very much hungrier still they had become before Mr Beaver said, "Now we're
nearly ready." Susan drained the potatoes and then put them all back in the empty pot to dry on the
side of the range while Lucy was helping Mrs Beaver to dish up the trout, so that in a very few
minutes everyone was drawing up their stools (it was all three-legged stools in the Beavers' house
except for Mrs Beaver's own special rockingchair beside the fire) and preparing to enjoy themselves.
There was a jug of creamy milk for the children (Mr Beaver stuck to beer) and a great big lump of
deep yellow butter in the middle of the table from which everyone took as much as he wanted to go
with his potatoes, and all the children thought - and I agree with them - that there's nothing to beat
good freshwater fish if you eat it when it has been alive half an hour ago and has come out of the pan
half a minute ago. And when they had finished the fish Mrs Beaver brought unexpectedly out of the
oven a great and gloriously sticky marmalade roll, steaming hot, and at the same time moved the
kettle on to the fire, so that when they had finished the marmalade roll the tea was made and ready to
be poured out. And when each person had got his (or her) cup of tea, each person shoved back his (or
her) stool so as to be able to lean against the wall and gave a long sigh of contentment.
"And now," said Mr Beaver, pushing away his empty beer mug and pulling his cup of tea towards
him, "if you'll just wait till I've got my pipe lit up and going nicely - why, now we can get to business.
It's snowing again," he added, cocking his eye at the window. "That's all the better, because it means
we shan't have any visitors; and if anyone should have been trying to follow you, why he won't find
any tracks."
 "AND now," said Lucy, "do please tell us what's happened to Mr Tumnus."
 "Ah, that's bad," said Mr Beaver, shaking his head. "That's a very, very bad business. There's no
doubt he was taken off by the police. I got that from a bird who saw it done."
 "But where's he been taken to?" asked Lucy.
"Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means."
 "No, we don't," said Susan. Mr Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion.
"I'm afraid it means they were taking him to her House," he said.
"But what'll they do to him, Mr Beaver?" gasped Lucy.
"Well," said Mr Beaver, "you can't exactly say for sure. But there's not many taken in there that ever
comes out again. Statues. All full of statues they say it is - in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the
hall. People she's turned" - (he paused and shuddered) "turned into stone."
 "But, Mr Beaver," said Lucy, "can't we - I mean we must do something to save him. It's too dreadful
and it's all on my account."
 "I don't doubt you'd save him if you could, dearie," said Mrs Beaver, "but you've no chance of
getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive."
 "Couldn't we have some stratagem?" said Peter. "I mean couldn't we dress up as something, or
pretend to be - oh, pedlars or anything - or watch till she was gone out - or- oh, hang it all, there must 
be some way. This Faun saved my sister at his own risk, Mr Beaver. We can't just leave him to be - to
be - to have that done to him."
 "It's no good, Son of Adam," said Mr Beaver, "no good your trying, of all people. But now that
Aslan is on the move-"
 "Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!" said several voices at once; for once again that strange feeling - like
the first signs of spring, like good news, had come over them.
"Who is Aslan?" asked Susan.
"Aslan?" said Mr Beaver. "Why, don't you know? He's the King. He's the Lord of the whole wood,
but not often here, you understand. Never in my time or my father's time. But the word has reached
us that he has come back. He is in Narnia at this moment. He'll settle the White Queen all right. It is
he, not you, that will save Mr Tumnus."
 "She won't turn him into stone too?" said Edmund.
"Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!" answered Mr Beaver with a great laugh.
"Turn him into stone? If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it'll be the most she
can do and more than I expect of her. No, no. He'll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these
parts:
 Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,
 At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,
 When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,
 And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.
You'll understand when you see him."
 "But shall we see him?" asked Susan.
"Why, Daughter of Eve, that's what I brought you here for. I'm to lead you where you shall meet
him," said Mr Beaver.
"Is-is he a man?" asked Lucy.
"Aslan a man!" said Mr Beaver sternly. "Certainly not. I tell you he is the King of the wood and the
son of the great Emperor-beyond-the-Sea. Don't you know who is the King of Beasts? Aslan is a lion
- the Lion, the great Lion."
 "Ooh!" said Susan, "I'd thought he was a man. Is he - quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about
meeting a lion."
 "That you will, dearie, and no mistake," said Mrs Beaver; "if there's anyone who can appear before
Aslan without their knees knocking, they're either braver than most or else just silly."
 "Then he isn't safe?" said Lucy.
"Safe?" said Mr Beaver; "don't you hear what Mrs Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe?
'Course he isn't safe. But he's good. He's the King, I tell you."
 "I'm longing to see him," said Peter, "even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point."
 "That's right, Son of Adam," said Mr Beaver, bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that 
made all the cups and saucers rattle. "And so you shall. Word has been sent that you are to meet him,
tomorrow if you can, at the Stone Table.’
"Where's that?" said Lucy.
"I'll show you," said Mr Beaver. "It's down the river, a good step from here. I'll take you to it!"
 "But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus?" said Lucy.
"The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan," said Mr Beaver, "once he's with us,
then we can begin doing things. Not that we don't need you too. For that's another of the old rhymes:
 When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone
 Sits at Cair Paravel in throne,
 The evil time will be over and done.
So things must be drawing near their end now he's come and you've come. We've heard of Aslan
coming into these parts before - long ago, nobody can say when. But there's never been any of your
race here before."
 "That's what I don't understand, Mr Beaver," said Peter, "I mean isn't the Witch herself human?"
 "She'd like us to believe it," said Mr Beaver, "and it's on that that she bases her claim to be Queen.
But she's no Daughter of Eve. She comes of your father Adam's" - (here Mr Beaver bowed) "your
father Adam's first wife, her they called Lilith. And she was one of the Jinn. That's what she comes
from on one side. And on the other she comes of the giants. No, no, there isn't a drop of real human
blood in the Witch."
 "That's why she's bad all through, Mr Beaver," said Mrs Beaver.
"True enough, Mrs Beaver," replied he, "there may be two views about humans (meaning no
offence to the present company). But there's no two views about things that look like humans and
aren't."
 "I've known good Dwarfs," said Mrs Beaver.
"So've I, now you come to speak of it," said her husband, "but precious few, and they were the ones
least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that's going to be human and
isn't yet, or used to be human once and isn't now, or ought to be human and isn't, you keep your eyes
on it and feel for your hatchet. And that's why the Witch is always on the lookout for any humans in
Narnia. She's been watching for you this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she'd be
more dangerous still."
 "What's that to do with it?" asked Peter.
"Because of another prophecy," said Mr Beaver. "Down at Cair Paravel - that's the castle on the sea
coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as
it should be - down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it's a saying in Narnia time out of mind
that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones, then it will be the
end not only of the White Witch's reign but of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we
came along, for if she knew about you four, your lives wouldn't be worth a shake of my whiskers!"
 All the children had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver was telling them that they had noticed
nothing else for a long time. Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark, Lucy
suddenly said:
 "I say-where's Edmund?"
 There was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking "Who saw him last? How long has he
been missing? Is he outside? and then all rushed to the door and looked out. The snow was falling 
thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from
where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank. Out they went,
plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction.
"Edmund! Edmund!" they called till they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle
their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.
"How perfectly dreadful!" said Susan as they at last came back in despair. "Oh, how I wish we'd
never come."
 "What on earth are we to do, Mr Beaver?" said Peter.
"Do?" said Mr Beaver, who was already putting on his snow-boots, "do? We must be off at once.
We haven't a moment to spare!"
 "We'd better divide into four search parties," said Peter, "and all go in different directions. Whoever
finds him must come back here at once and-"
 "Search parties, Son of Adam?" said Mr Beaver; "what for?"
 "Why, to look for Edmund, of course!"
 "There's no point in looking for him," said Mr Beaver.
"What do you mean?" said Susan. "He can't be far away yet. And we've got to find him. What do
you mean when you say there's no use looking for him?"
 "The reason there's no use looking," said Mr Beaver, "is that we know already where he's gone!"
Everyone stared in amazement. "Don't you understand?" said Mr Beaver. "He's gone to her, to the
White Witch. He has betrayed us all."
 "Oh, surely-oh, really!" said Susan, "he can't have done that."
 "Can't he?" said Mr Beaver, looking very hard at the three children, and everything they wanted to
say died on their lips, for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this was exactly what Edmund
had done.
"But will he know the way?" said Peter.
"Has he been in this country before?" asked Mr Beaver. "Has he ever been here alone?"
 "Yes," said Lucy, almost in a whisper. "I'm afraid he has."
 "And did he tell you what he'd done or who he'd met?"
 "Well, no, he didn't," said Lucy.
"Then mark my words," said Mr Beaver, "he has already met the White Witch and joined her side,
and been told where she lives. I didn't like to mention it before (he being your brother and all) but the
moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself `Treacherous'. He had the look of one who
has been with the Witch and eaten her food. You can always tell them if you've lived long in Narnia;
something about their eyes."
 "All the same," said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, "we'll still have to go and look for him.
He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a little beast. And he's only a kid."
 "Go to the Witch's House?" said Mrs Beaver. "Don't you see that the only chance of saving either
him or yourselves is to keep away from her?"
 "How do you mean?" said Lucy.
"Why, all she wants is to get all four of you (she's thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair
Paravel). Once you were all four inside her House her job would be done - and there'd be four new
statues in her collection before you'd had time to speak. But she'll keep him alive as long as he's the
only one she's got, because she'll want to use him as a decoy; as bait to catch the rest of you with."
 "Oh, can no one help us?" wailed Lucy.
"Only Aslan," said Mr Beaver, "we must go on and meet him. That's our only chance now."
 "It seems to me, my dears," said Mrs Beaver, "that it is very important to know just when he slipped
away. How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard. For instance, had we started talking
of Aslan before he left? If not, then we may do very well, for she won't know that Aslan has come to
Narnia, or that we are meeting him, and will be quite off her guard as far as that is concerned."
 "I don't remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan -" began Peter, but Lucy
interrupted him.
"Oh yes, he was," she said miserably; "don't you remember, it was he who asked whether the Witch
couldn't turn Aslan into stone too?"
 "So he did, by Jove," said Peter; "just the sort of thing he would say, too!"
 "Worse and worse," said Mr Beaver, "and the next thing is this. Was he still here when I told you
that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?"
 And of course no one knew the answer to this question.
"Because, if he was," continued Mr Beaver, "then she'll simply sledge down in that direction and get
between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down. In fact we shall be cut off from
Aslan. "
 "But that isn't what she'll do first," said Mrs Beaver, "not if I know her. The moment that Edmund
tells her that we're all here she'll set out to catch us this very night, and if he's been gone about half an
hour, she'll be here in about another twenty minutes."
 "You're right, Mrs Beaver," said her husband, "we must all get away from here. There's not a
moment to lose."
 AND now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. He had eaten his share of the
dinner, but he hadn't really enjoyed it because he was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight -
and there's nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad
magic food. And he had heard the conversation, and hadn't enjoyed it much either, because he kept
on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder.
They weren't, but he imagined it. And then he had listened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan
and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that
he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For the mention of
Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a mysterious and lovely
feeling.
Just as Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam's flesh and Adam's bone Edmund had
been very quietly turning the doorhandle; and just before Mr Beaver had begun telling them that the
White Witch wasn't really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got outside
into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him.
You mustn't think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and
sisters to be turned into stone. He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince (and later a King) and
to pay Peter out for calling him a beast. As for what the Witch would do with the others, he didn't
want her to be particularly nice to them - certainly not to put them on the same level as himself; but
he managed to believe, or to pretend he believed, that she wouldn't do anything very bad to them,
"Because," he said to himself, "all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and
probably half of it isn't true. She was jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are. I expect she 
is the rightful Queen really. Anyway, she'll be better than that awful Aslan!" At least, that was the
excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing. It wasn't a very good excuse, however, for
deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel.
The first thing he realised when he got outside and found the snow falling all round him, was that he
had left his coat behind in the Beavers' house. And of course there was no chance of going back to
get it now. The next thing he realised was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly
three o'clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short. He hadn't reckoned on
this; but he had to make the best of it. So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the
dam (luckily it wasn't so slippery since the snow had fallen) to the far side of the river.
It was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker every minute and what with
that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he could hardly see three feet ahead. And then too
there was no road. He kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and
tripping over fallen tree-trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking his shins against rocks, till
he was wet and cold and bruised all over. The silence and the loneliness were dreadful. In fact I really
think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the
others, if he hadn't happened to say to himself, "When I'm King of Narnia the first thing I shall do
will be to make some decent roads." And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and
all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal. He had just settled in his mind
what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and all about his private cinema and where the
principal railways would run and what laws he would make against beavers and dams and was
putting the finishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place, when the weather
changed. First the snow stopped. Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold. Finally, the
clouds rolled away and the moon came out. It was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it made
everything almost as bright as day - only the shadows were rather confusing.
He would never have found his way if the moon hadn't come out by the time he got to the other
river you remember he had seen (when they first arrived at the Beavers') a smaller river flowing into
the great one lower down. He now reached this and turned to follow it up. But the little valley down
which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with
bushes, so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark. Even as it was, he got wet through for
he had to stoop under branches and great loads of snow came sliding off on to his back. And every
time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter - just as if all this had been Peter's
fault.
But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out. And there, on the
other side of the river, quite close to him, in the middle of a little plain between two hills, he saw
what must be the White Witch's House. And the moon was shining brighter than ever. The House
was really a small castle. It seemed to be all towers; little towers with long pointed spires on them,
sharp as needles. They looked like huge dunce's caps or sorcerer's caps. And they shone in the
moonlight and their long shadows looked strange on the snow. Edmund began to be afraid of the 
House.
But it was too late to think of turning back now.
He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the House. There was nothing stirring; not the
slightest sound anywhere. Even his own feet made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow. He
walked on and on, past corner after corner of the House, and past turret after turret to find the door.
He had to go right round to the far side before he found it. It was a huge arch but the great iron gates
stood wide open.
Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and there he saw a sight that
nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, with the moonlight shining on it, stood an
enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring. And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch,
afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his knees knocking together. He stood there so long that
his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear. How
long this really lasted I don't know, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.
Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still - for it hadn't moved one inch
since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in the shadow of the
arch as much as he could. He now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
looking at him at all. ("But supposing it turns its head?" thought Edmund.) In fact it was staring at
something else namely a little: dwarf who stood with his back to it about four feet away. "Aha!"
thought Edmund. "When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape." But still the lion
never moved, nor did the dwarf. And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about
the White Witch turning people into stone. Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And as soon as he had
thought of that he noticed that the lion's back and the top of its head were covered with snow. Of
course it must be only a statue! No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow. Then
very slowly and with his heart beating as if it would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion.
Even now he hardly dared to touch it, but at last he put out his hand, very quickly, and did. It was
cold stone. He had been frightened of a mere statue!
 The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over
right down to his toes, and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely
idea. "Probably," he thought, "this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about. She's
caught him already and turned him into stone. So that's the end of all their fine ideas about him!
Pooh! Who's afraid of Aslan?"
 And he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he did something very silly and 
childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion's
upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes. Then he said, "Yah! Silly old Aslan! How do you
like being a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn't you?" But in spite of the scribbles on it
the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible, and sad, and noble, staring up in the
moonlight, that Edmund didn't really get any fun out of jeering at it. He turned away and began to
cross the courtyard.
As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues all about - standing here and
there rather as the pieces stand on a chess-board when it is half-way through the game. There were
stone satyrs, and stone wolves, and bears and foxes and cat-amountains of stone. There were lovely
stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees. There was the great
shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon.
They all looked so strange standing there perfectly life-like and also perfectly still, in the bright cold
moonlight, that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard. Right in the very middle stood a huge shape
like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right
hand. Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund did not like
going past it.
He now saw that there was a dim light showing from a doorway on the far side of the courtyard. He
went to it; there was a flight of stone steps going up to an open door. Edmund went up them. Across
the threshold lay a great wolf.
"It's all right, it's all right," he kept saying to himself; "it's only a stone wolf. It can't hurt me", and he
raised his leg to step over it. Instantly the huge creature rose, with all the hair bristling along its back,
opened a great, red mouth and said in a growling voice:
 "Who's there? Who's there? Stand still, stranger, and tell me who you are."
 "If you please, sir," said Edmund, trembling so that he could hardly speak, "my name is Edmund,
and I'm the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I've come to bring her
the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia - quite close, in the Beavers' house. She - she
wanted to see them."
 "I will tell Her Majesty," said the Wolf. "Meanwhile, stand still on the threshold, as you value your
life." Then it vanished into the house.
Edmund stood and waited, his fingers aching with cold and his heart pounding in his chest, and
presently the grey wolf, Maugrim, the Chief of the Witch's Secret Police, came bounding back and
said, "Come in! Come in! Fortunate favourite of the Queen - or else not so fortunate."
 And Edmund went in, taking great care not to tread on the Wolf's paws.
He found himself in a long gloomy hall with many pillars, full, as the courtyard had been, of statues.
The one nearest the door was a little faun with a very sad expression on its face, and Edmund couldn't
help wondering if this might be Lucy's friend. The only light came from a single lamp and close
beside this sat the White Witch.
"I'm come, your Majesty," said Edmund, rushing eagerly forward.
"How dare you come alone?" said the Witch in a terrible voice. "Did I not tell you to bring the
others with you?"
 "Please, your Majesty," said Edmund, "I've done the best I can. I've brought them quite close.
They're in the little house on top of the dam just up the riverwith Mr and Mrs Beaver."
 A slow cruel smile came over the Witch's face.
"Is this all your news?" she asked.
"No, your Majesty," said Edmund, and proceeded to tell her all he had heard before leaving the
Beavers' house.
"What! Aslan?" cried the Queen, "Aslan! Is this true? If I find you have lied to me -"
 "Please, I'm only repeating what they said," stammered Edmund.
But the Queen, who was no longer attending to him, clapped her hands. Instantly the same dwarf
whom Edmund had seen with her before appeared.
"Make ready our sledge," ordered the Witch, "and use the harness without bells."
Now we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other children. As soon as Mr Beaver
said, "There's no time to lose," everyone began bundling themselves into coats, except Mrs Beaver,
who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said: "Now, Mr Beaver, just reach
down that ham. And here's a packet of tea, and there's sugar, and some matches. And if someone will
get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner."
 "What are you doing, Mrs Beaver?" exclaimed Susan.
"Packing a load for each of us, dearie," said Mrs Beaver very coolly. "You didn't think we'd set out
on a journey with nothing to eat, did you?"
 "But we haven't time!" said Susan, buttoning the collar of her coat. "She may be here any minute."
 "That's what I say," chimed in Mr Beaver.
"Get along with you all," said his wife. "Think it over, Mr Beaver. She can't be here for quarter of an
hour at least."
 "But don't we want as big a start as we can possibly get," said Peter, "if we're to reach the Stone
Table before her?"
 "You've got to remember that, Mrs Beaver," said Susan. "As soon as she has looked in here and finds
we're gone she'll be off at top speed."
 "That she will," said Mrs Beaver. "But we can't get there before her whatever we do, for she'll be on
a sledge and we'll be walking."
 "Then - have we no hope?" said Susan.
"Now don't you get fussing, there's a dear," said Mrs Beaver, "but just get half a dozen clean
handkerchiefs out of the drawer. 'Course we've got a hope. We can't get there before her but we can
keep under cover and go by ways she won't expect and perhaps we'll get through."
 "That's true enough, Mrs Beaver," said her husband. "But it's time we were out of this."
 "And don't you start fussing either, Mr Beaver," said his wife. "There. That's better. There's five
loads and the smallest for the smallest of us: that's you, my dear," she added, looking at Lucy.
"Oh, do please come on," said Lucy.
"Well, I'm nearly ready now," answered Mrs Beaver at last, allowing her husband to help her into;
her snow-boots. "I suppose the sewing machine's took heavy to bring?"
 "Yes. It is," said Mr Beaver. "A great deal too heavy. And you don't think you'll be able to use it
while we're on the run, I suppose?"
 "I can't abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it," said Mrs Beaver, "and breaking it or
stealing it, as likely as not."
 "Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!" said the three children. And so at last they all got outside and
Mr Beaver locked the door ("It'll delay her a bit," he said) and they set off, all carrying their loads
over their shoulders.
The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey. They went in
single file - first Mr Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, then Susan, and Mrs Beaver last of all. Mr Beaver
led them across the dam and on to the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path
among the trees right down by the river-bank. The sides of the valley, shining in the moonlight,
towered up far above them on either hand. "Best keep down here as much as possible," he said.
"She'll have to keep to the top, for you couldn't bring a sledge down here."
 It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable
armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first. But as they went on walking and walking
- and walking and as the sack she was carrying felt heavier and heavier, she began to wonder how she
was going to keep up at all. And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river
with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree-tops and the great glaring moon and
the countless stars and could only watch the little short legs of Mr Beaver going pad-pad-pad-pad
through the snow in front of her as if they were never going to stop. Then the moon disappeared and
the snow began to fall once more. And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and
walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turned away from the riverbank
to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes. And then as she
came fully awake she found that Mr Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had
been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it. In fact, by the time she realised
what was happening, only his short flat tail was showing.
Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she heard noises of scrambling and
puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them were inside.
"Wherever is this?" said Peter's voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness. (I hope you know
what I mean by a voice sounding pale.)
 "It's an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times," said Mr Beaver, "and a great secret. It's not much
