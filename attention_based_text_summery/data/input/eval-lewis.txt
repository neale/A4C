So he sent the word to slay 
And slew the little childer. 
I doubt whether we are sufficiently attentive to the importance of elementary text 
books. That is why I have chosen as the starting-point for these lectures a Uttle 
book on English intended for 'boys and girls in the upper forms of schools'. I do 
not think the authors of this book (there were two of them) intended any harm, 
and I owe them, or their publisher, good language for sending me a 
compUmentary copy. At the same time I shall have nothing good to say of them. 
Here is a pretty predicament. I do not want to pillory two modest practising 
schoolmasters who were doing the best they knew: but I cannot be silent about 
what I think the actual tendency of their work. I therefore propose to conceal their 
names. I shall refer to these gentlemen as Gains and Titius and to their book as 
The Green Book. But I promise you there is such a book and I have it on my 
shelves. 
In their second chapter Gains and Titius quote the well-known story of Coleridge 
at the waterfall. You remember that there were two tourists present: that one 
called it 'sublime' and the other 'pretty'; and that Coleridge mentally endorsed the 
first judgement and rejected the second with disgust. Gains and Titius comment 
as follows: 'When the man said This is sublime., he appeared to be making a remark 
about the waterfall... Actually ... he was not making a remark about the waterfall, 
but a remark about his own feeUngs. What he was saying was really / have feelings 
associated in my mind with the word " Sublime" i or shortly, I have sublime feelings' Yitrt 
are a good many deep questions settled in a pretty summary fashion. But the 
authors are not yet finished. They add: 'This confusion is continually present in 
language as we use it. We appear to be saying something very important about 
something: and actually we are only saying something about our own feelings.'' 
Before considering the issues really raised by this momentous little paragraph 
(designed, you will remember, for 'the upper forms of schools') we must eliminate 
one mere confusion into which Gains and Titius have fallen. Even on their own 
view — on any conceivable view — the man who says This is sublime cannot mean / 
have sublime feelings. Even if it were granted that such qualities as sublimity were 
simply and solely projected into things from our own emotions, yet the emotions 
which prompt the projection are the correlatives, and therefore almost the 
opposites, of the qualities projected. The feelings which make a man call an object 
subUme are not sublime feelings but feelings of veneration. If This is sublime is to 
be reduced at all to a statement about the speaker's feeUngs, the proper translation 
would be / have humble feelings. If the view held by Gaius and Titius were 
consistently applied it would lead to obvious absurdities. It would force them to 
maintain that You are contemptible means / have contemptible feelings ', in fact that 
Your feelings are contemptible means My feelings are contemptible. But we need not 
delay over this which is the very pons asinorum of our subject. It would be unjust to 
Gaius and Titius themselves to emphasize what was doubtless a mere 
inadvertence. 
The schoolboy who reads this passage in The Green Book will believe two 
propositions: firstly, that all sentences containing a predicate of value are 
statements about the emotional state of the speaker, and secondly, that all such 
statements are unimportant. It is true that Gaius and Titius have said neither of 
these things in so many words. They have treated only one particular predicate of 
value (sublime) as a word descriptive of the speaker's emotions. The pupils are left 
to do for themselves the work of extending the same treatment to all predicates of 
value: and no slightest obstacle to such extension is placed in their way. The 
authors may or may not desire the extension: they may never have given the 
question five minutes' serious thought in their lives. I am not concerned with what 
they desired but with the effect their book will certainly have on the schoolboy's 
mind. In the same way, they have not said that judgements of value are 
unimportant. Their words are that we 'appear to be saying something very 
important' when in reality we are 'only saying something about our own feeUngs'. 
No schoolboy will be able to resist the suggestion brought to bear upon him by 
that word only. I do not mean, of course, that he will make any conscious 
inference from what he reads to a general philosophical theory that all values are 
subjective and trivial. The very power of Gaius and Titius depends on the fact that 
they are dealing with a boy: a boy who thinks he is 'doing' his 'English prep' and 
has no notion that ethics, theology, and politics are all at stake. It is not a theory 
they put into his mind, but an assumption, which ten years hence, its origin 
forgotten and its presence unconscious, will condition him to take one side in a 
controversy which he has never recognized as a controversy at all. The authors 
themselves, I suspect, hardly know what they are doing to the boy, and he cannot 
know what is being done to him. 
Before considering the philosophical credentials of the position which Gaius and 
Titius have adopted about value, I should like to show its practical results on the 
educational procedure. In their fourth chapter they quote a silly advertisement of a 
pleasure cruise and proceed to inoculate their pupils against the sort of writing it 
exhibits. 2 The advertisement tells us that those who buy tickets for this cruise will 
go 'across the Western Ocean where Drake of Devon sailed', 'adventuring after the 
treasures of the Indies', and bringing home themselves also a 'treasure' of 'golden 
hours' and 'glowing colours'. It is a bad bit of writing, of course: a venal and 
bathetic exploitation of those emotions of awe and pleasure which men feel in 
visiting places that have striking associations with history or legend. If Gaius and 
Titius were to stick to their last and teach their readers (as they promised to do) 
the art of English composition, it was their business to put this advertisement side 
by side with passages from great writers in which the very emotion is well 
expressed, and then show where the difference lies. 
They might have used Johnson's famous passage from the Western Islands, which 
concludes: 'That man is little to be envied, whose patriotism would not gain force 
upon the plain of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the 
ruins of lona.'^ They might have taken that place in The Prelude where Wordsworth 
describes how the antiquity of London first descended on his mind with 'Weight 
and power, Power growing under weight'.'' A lesson which had laid such literature 
beside the advertisement and really discriminated the good from the bad would 
have been a lesson worth teaching. There would have been some blood and sap in 
it — the trees of knowledge and of life growing together. It would also have had the 
merit of being a lesson in literature: a subject of which Gains and Titius, despite 
their professed purpose, are uncommonly shy. 
What they actually do is to point out that the luxurious motor-vessel won't really 
sail where Drake did, that the tourists will not have any adventures, that the 
treasures they bring home will be of a purely metaphorical nature, and that a trip 
to Margate might provide 'all the pleasure and rest' they required. ^ All this is very 
true: talents inferior to those of Gains and Titius would have sufficed to discover 
it. What they have not noticed, or not cared about, is that a very similar treatment 
could be apphed to much good literature which treats the same emotion. What, 
after all, can the history of early British Christianity, in pure reason, add to the 
motives for piety as they exist in the eighteenth century? Why should Mr 
Wordsworth's inn be more comfortable or the air of London more healthy because 
London has existed for a long time? Or, if there is indeed any obstacle which will 
prevent a critic from 'debunking' Johnson and Wordsworth (and Lamb, and Virgil, 
and Thomas Browne, and Mr de la Mare) as The Green Book debunks the 
advertisement, Gaius and Titius have given their schoolboy readers no faintest 
help to its discovery. 
From this passage the schoolboy will learn about Uterature precisely nothing. What 
he will learn quickly enough, and perhaps indelibly, is the belief that all emotions 
aroused by local association are in themselves contrary to reason and 
contemptible. He will have no notion that there are two ways of being immune to 
such an advertisement — that it falls equally flat on those who are above it and 
those who are below it, on the man of real sensibility and on the mere trousered 
ape who has never been able to conceive the Atlantic as anything more than so 
many million tons of cold salt water. There are two men to whom we offer in vain 
a false leading article on patriotism and honour: one is the coward, the other is the 
honourable and patriotic man. None of this is brought before the schoolboy's 
mind. On the contrary, he is encouraged to reject the lure of the 'Western Ocean' 
on the very dangerous ground that in so doing he will prove himself a knowing 
fellow who can't be bubbled out of his cash. Gaius and Titius, while teaching him 
nothing about letters, have cut out of his soul, long before he is old enough to 
choose, the possibility of having certain experiences which thinkers of more 
authority than they have held to be generous, fruitful, and humane. But it is not 
only Gaius and Titius. In another little book, whose author I will call OrbiUus, I 
find that the same operation, under the same general anaesthetic, is being carried 
out. Orbilius chooses for 'debunking' a silly bit of writing on horses, where these 
animals are praised as the 'willing servants' of the early colonists in Austraha.'^ And 
he falls into the same trap as Gaius and Titius. Of Ruksh and Sleipnir and the 
weeping horses of Achilles and the war-horse in the Book of Job — nay even of Brer 
Rabbit and of Peter Rabbit — of man's prehistoric piety to 'our brother the ox' — of 
all that this semi-anthropomorphic treatment of beasts has meant in human 
history and of the Uterature where it finds noble or piquant expression — he has not 
a word to say.^ Even of the problems of animal psychology as they exist for science 
he says nothing. He contents himself with explaining that horses are not, secundum 
litteram, interested in colonial expansion.*^ This piece of information is really all 
that his pupils get from him. Why the composition before them is bad, when 
others that lie open to the same charge are good, they do not hear. Much less do 
they learn of the two classes of men who are, respectively, above and below the 
danger of such writing — the man who really knows horses and really loves them, 
not with anthropomorphic illusions, but with ordinate love, and the irredeemable 
urban blockhead to whom a horse is merely an old-fashioned means of transport. 
Some pleasure in their own ponies and dogs they will have lost; some incentive to 
cruelty or neglect they will have received; some pleasure in their own knowingness 
will have entered their minds. That is their day's lesson in English, though of 
English they have learned nothing. Another Uttle portion of the human heritage 
has been quietly taken from them before they were old enough to understand. 
I have hitherto been assuming that such teachers as Gaius and Titius do not fully 
realize what they are doing and do not intend the far-reaching consequences it will 
actually have. There is, of course, another possibility. What I have called 
(presuming on their concurrence in a certain traditional system of values) the 
'trousered ape' and the 'urban blockhead' may be precisely the kind of man they 
really wish to produce. The differences between us may go all the way down. They 
may really hold that the ordinary human feeUngs about the past or animals or large 
waterfalls are contrary to reason and contemptible and ought to be eradicated. 
They may be intending to make a clean sweep of traditional values and start with a 
new set. That position will be discussed later. If it is the position which Gaius and 
Titius are holding, I must, for the moment, content myself with pointing out that 
it is a philosophical and not a literary position. In filling their book with it they 
have been unjust to the parent or headmaster who buys it and who has got the 
work of amateur philosophers where he expected the work of professional 
grammarians. A man would be annoyed if his son returned from the dentist with 
his teeth untouched and his head crammed with the dentist's obiter dicta on 
bimetallism or the Baconian theory. 
But I doubt whether Gaius and Titius have really planned, under cover of teaching 
English, to propagate their philosophy. I think they have slipped into it for the 
following reasons. In the first place, literary criticism is difficult, and what they 
actually do is very much easier. To explain why a bad treatment of some basic 
human emotion is bad Uterature is, if we exclude all question-begging attacks on 
the emotion itself, a very hard thing to do. Even Dr Richards, who first seriously 
tackled the problem of badness in literature, failed, I think, to do it. To 'debunk' 
the emotion, on the basis of a commonplace rationalism, is within almost anyone's 
capacity. In the second place, I think Gaius and Titius may have honestly 
misunderstood the pressing educational need of the moment. They see the world 
around them swayed by emotional propaganda — they have learned from tradition 
that youth is sentimental — and they conclude that the best thing they can do is to 
fortify the minds of young people against emotion. My own experience as a 
teacher tells an opposite tale. For every one pupil who needs to be guarded from a 
weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the 
slumber of cold vulgarity. The task of the modern educator is not to cut down 
jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defence against false sentiments is to 
inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make 
them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. For famished nature will be 
avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head. 
But there is a third, and a profounder, reason for the procedure which Gaius and 
Titius adopt. They may be perfectly ready to admit that a good education should 
build some sentiments while destroying others. They may endeavour to do so. But 
it is impossible that they should succeed. Do what they will, it is the 'debunking' 
side of their work, and this side alone, which will really tell. In order to grasp this 
necessity clearly I must digress for a moment to show that what may be called the 
educational predicament of Gaius and Titius is different from that of all their 
predecessors. 
Until quite modern times all teachers and even all men believed the universe to be 
such that certain emotional reactions on our part could be either congruous or 
incongruous to it — believed, in fact, that objects did not merely receive, but could 
merit., our approval or disapproval, our reverence or our contempt. The reason why 
Coleridge agreed with the tourist who called the cataract sublime and disagreed 
with the one who called it pretty was of course that he believed inanimate nature 
to be such that certain responses could be more 'just' or 'ordinate' or 'appropriate' 
to it than others. And he beheved (correctly) that the tourists thought the same. 
The man who called the cataract sublime was not intending simply to describe his 
own emotions about it: he was also claiming that the object was one which merited 
those emotions. But for this claim there would be nothing to agree or disagree 
about. To disagree with This is pretty if those words simply described the lady's 
feelings, would be absurd: if she had said I feel sick Coleridge would hardly have 
replied No; I feel quite well. When Shelley, having compared the human sensibiUty 
to an Aeolian lyre, goes on to add that it differs from a lyre in having a power of 
'internal adjustment' whereby it can 'accommodate its chords to the motions of 
that which strikes them',^ he is assuming the same behef. 'Can you be righteous', 
asks Traherne, 'unless you be just in rendering to things their due esteem? All 
things were made to be yours and you were made to prize them according to their 
value. 
St Augustine defines virtue as ordo amoris, the ordinate condition of the affections 
in which every object is accorded that kind of degree of love which is appropriate 
to it." Aristotle says that the aim of education is to make the pupil like and dislike 
what he ought. '^ When the age for reflective thought comes, the pupil who has 
been thus trained in 'ordinate affections' or 'just sentiments' will easily find the first 
principles in Ethics; but to the corrupt man they will never be visible at all and he 
can make no progress in that science.'^ Plato before him had said the same. The 
little human animal will not at first have the right responses. It must be trained to 
feel pleasure, liking, disgust, and hatred at those things which really are pleasant, 
likeable, disgusting and hateful.'^ In the Republic, the well-nurtured youth is one 
'who would see most clearly whatever was amiss in ill-made works of man or ill- 
grown works of nature, and with a just distaste would blame and hate the ugly 
even from his earhest years and would give delighted praise to beauty, receiving it 
into his soul and being nourished by it, so that he becomes a man of gentle heart. 
All this before he is of an age to reason; so that when Reason at length comes to 
him, then, bred as he has been, he will hold out his hands in welcome and 
recognize her because of the affinity he bears to her.''^ in early Hinduism that 
conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost 
participation in, the Rta — that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature 
which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial 
of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified 
with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 
'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so 
the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it.'* 
The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the 
reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is 
Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the 
Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and 
time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic 
and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar.'^ 'In 
ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.'"^ The ancient 
Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'.'' 
This conception in all its forms, Platonic, AristoteUan, Stoic, Christian, and 
Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'. Some of 
the accounts of it which I have quoted will seem, perhaps, to many of you merely 
quaint or even magical. But what is common to them all is something we cannot 
neglect. It is the doctrine of objective value, the behef that certain attitudes are 
really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind 
of things we are. Those who know the Tao can hold that to call children delightful 
or old men venerable is not simply to record a psychological fact about our own 
parental or fihal emotions at the moment, but to recognize a quality which 
demands a certain response from us whether we make it or not. I myself do not 
enjoy the society of small children: because I speak from within the Tao I 
recognize this as a defect in myself — just as a man may have to recognize that he is 
tone deaf or colour bUnd. And because our approvals and disapprovals are thus 
recognitions of objective value or responses to an objective order, therefore 
emotional states can be in harmony with reason (when we feel liking for what 
ought to be approved) or out of harmony with reason (when we perceive that 
liking is due but cannot feel it). No emotion is, in itself, a judgement; in that sense 
all emotions and sentiments are alogical. But they can be reasonable or 
unreasonable as they conform to Reason or fail to conform. The heart never takes 
the place of the head: but it can, and should, obey it. 
Over against this stands the world of The Green Book. In it the very possibility of a 
sentiment being reasonable — or even unreasonable — has been excluded from the 
outset. It can be reasonable or unreasonable only if it conforms or fails to conform 
to something else. To say that the cataract is sublime means saying that our 
emotion of humility is appropriate or ordinate to the reality, and thus to speak of 
something else besides the emotion; just as to say that a shoe fits is to speak not 
only of shoes but of feet. But this reference to something beyond the emotion is 
what Gaius and Titius exclude from every sentence containing a predicate of 
value. Such statements, for them, refer solely to the emotion. Now the emotion, 
thus considered by itself, cannot be either in agreement or disagreement with 
Reason. It is irrational not as a paralogism is irrational, but as a physical event is 
irrational: it does not rise even to the dignity of error. On this view, the world of 
facts, without one trace of value, and the world of feeUngs, without one trace of 
truth or falsehood, justice or injustice, confront one another, and no rapprochement 
is possible. 
Hence the educational problem is wholly different according as you stand within 
or without the Tao. For those within, the task is to train in the pupil those 
responses which are in themselves appropriate, whether anyone is making them or 
not, and in making which the very nature of man consists. Those without, if they 
are logical, must regard all sentiments as equally non-rational, as mere mists 
between us and the real objects. As a result, they must either decide to remove all 
sentiments, as far as possible, from the pupil's mind; or else to encourage some 
sentiments for reasons that have nothing to do with their intrinsic 'justness' or 
'ordinacy'. The latter course involves them in the questionable process of creating 
in others by 'suggestion' or incantation a mirage which their own reason has 
successfully dissipated. 
Perhaps this will become clearer if we take a concrete instance. When a Roman 
father told his son that it was a sweet and seemly thing to die for his country, he 
believed what he said. He was communicating to the son an emotion which he 
himself shared and which he beUeved to be in accord with the value which his 
judgement discerned in noble death. He was giving the boy the best he had, giving 
of his spirit to humanize him as he had given of his body to beget him. But Gaius 
and Titius cannot believe that in calling such a death sweet and seemly they would 
be saying 'something important about something'. Their own method of 
debunking would cry out against them if they attempted to do so. For death is not 
something to eat and therefore cannot be duke in the literal sense, and it is unlikely 
that the real sensations preceding it will be dulce even by analogy. And as for 
decorum — that is only a word describing how some other people will feel about 
your death when they happen to think of it, which won't be often, and will 
certainly do you no good. There are only two courses open to Gaius and Titius. 
Either they must go the whole way and debunk this sentiment like any other, or 
must set themselves to work to produce, from outside, a sentiment which they 
believe to be of no value to the pupil and which may cost him his life, because it is 
useful to us (the survivors) that our young men should feel it. If they embark on 
this course the difference between the old and the new education will be an 
important one. Where the old initiated, the new merely 'conditions'. The old dealt 
with its pupils as grown birds deal with young birds when they teach them to fly; 
the new deals with them more as the poultry-keeper deals with young birds — 
making them thus or thus for purposes of which the birds know nothing. In a 
word, the old was a kind of propagation — men transmitting manhood to men; the 
new is merely propaganda. 
It is to their credit that Gaius and Titius embrace the first alternative. Propaganda 
is their abomination: not because their own philosophy gives a ground for 
condemning it (or anything else) but because they are better than their principles. 
They probably have some vague notion (I will examine it in my next lecture) that 
valour and good faith and justice could be sufficiently commended to the pupil on 
what they would call 'rational' or 'biological' or 'modern' grounds, if it should ever 
become necessary. In the meantime, they leave the matter alone and get on with 
the business of debunking. But this course, though less inhuman, is not less 
disastrous than the opposite alternative of cynical propaganda. Let us suppose for 
a moment that the harder virtues could really be theoretically justified with no 
appeal to objective value. It still remains true that no justification of virtue will 
enable a man to be virtuous. Without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is 
powerless against the animal organism. I had sooner play cards against a man who 
was quite sceptical about ethics, but bred to believe that 'a gentleman does not 
cheat', than against an irreproachable moral philosopher who had been brought up 
among sharpers. In battle it is not syllogisms that will keep the reluctant nerves 
and muscles to their post in the third hour of the bombardment. The crudest 
sentimentalism (such as Gaius and Titius would wince at) about a flag or a 
country or a regiment will be of more use. We were told it all long ago by Plato. As 
the king governs by his executive, so Reason in man must rule the mere appetites 
by means of the 'spirited element'. ^o The head rules the belly through the chest — 
the seat, as Alanus tells us, of Magnanimity,^! of emotions organized by trained 
habit into stable sentiments. The Chest-Magnanimity-Sentiment — these are the 
indispensable liaison officers between cerebral man and visceral man. It may even 
be said that it is by this middle element that man is man: for by his intellect he is 
mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal. 
The operation of The Green Book and its kind is to produce what may be called 
Men without Chests. It is an outrage that they should be commonly spoken of as 
Intellectuals. This gives them the chance to say that he who attacks them attacks 
Intelligence. It is not so. They are not distinguished from other men by any 
unusual skill in finding truth nor any virginal ardour to pursue her. Indeed it 
would be strange if they were: a persevering devotion to truth, a nice sense of 
intellectual honour, cannot be long maintained without the aid of a sentiment 
which Gaius and Titius could debunk as easily as any other. It is not excess of 
thought but defect of fertile and generous emotion that marks them out. Their 
heads are no bigger than the ordinary: it is the atrophy of the chest beneath that 
makes them seem so. 
And all the time — such is the tragi-comedy of our situation — we continue to 
clamour for those very qualities we are rendering impossible. You can hardly open 
a periodical without coming across the statement that what our civilization needs 
is more 'drive', or dynamism, or self-sacrifice, or 'creativity'. In a sort of ghastly 
simpUcity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without 
chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are 
shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful. 
The practical result of education in the spirit of The Green Book must be the 
destruction of the society which accepts it. But this is not necessarily a refutation 
of subjectivism about values as a theory. The true doctrine might be a doctrine 
which if we accept we die. No one who speaks from within the Tao could reject it 
on that account: '£v 5s cpasi kqi '5A£aaou. But it has not yet come to that. There 
are theoretical difficulties in the philosophy of Gains and Titius. 
However subjective they may be about some traditional values, Gains and Titius 
have shown by the very act of writing The Green Book that there must be some 
other values about which they are not subjective at all. They write in order to 
produce certain states of mind in the rising generation, if not because they think 
those states of mind intrinsically just or good, yet certainly because they think 
them to be the means to some state of society which they regard as desirable. It 
would not be difficult to collect from various passages in The Green Book what 
their ideal is. But we need not. The important point is not the precise nature of 
their end, but the fact that they have an end at all. They must have, or their book 
(being purely practical in intention) is written to no purpose. And this end must 
have real value in their eyes. To abstain from caUing it good and to use, instead, 
such predicates as 'necessary' or 'progressive' or 'efficient' would be a subterfuge. 
They could be forced by argument to answer the questions 'necessary for what?', 
'progressing towards what?', 'effecting what?'; in the last resort they would have to 
admit that some state of affairs was in their opinion good for its own sake. And this 
time they could not maintain that 'good' simply described their own emotion about 
it. For the whole purpose of their book is so to condition theyoung reader that he 
will share their approval, and this would be either a fool's or a villain's undertaking 
unless they held that their approval was in some way vahd or correct. 
In actual fact Gains and Titius will be found to hold, with complete uncritical 
dogmatism, the whole system of values which happened to be in vogue among 
moderately educated young men of the professional classes during the period 
between the two wars.' Their scepticism about values is on the surface: it is for use 
on other people's values; about the values current in their own set they are not 
nearly sceptical enough. And this phenomenon is very usual. A great many of 
those who 'debunk' traditional or (as they would say) 'sentimental' values have in 
the background values of their own which they beUeve to be immune from the 
debunking process. They claim to be cutting away the parasitic growth of emotion, 
religious sanction, and inherited taboos, in order that 'real' or 'basic' values may 
emerge. I will now try to find out what happens if this is seriously attempted. 
Let us continue to use the previous example — that of death for a good cause — not, 
of course, because virtue is the only value or martyrdom the only virtue, but 
because this is the experimentum crucis which shows different systems of thought in 
the clearest light. Let us suppose that an Innovator in values regards duke et 
decorum and greater love hath no man as mere irrational sentiments which are to be 
stripped off in order that we may get down to the 'reaUstic' or 'basic' ground of this 
value. Where will he find such a ground? 
First of all, he might say that the real value lay in the utiUty of such sacrifice to the 
community. 'Good', he might say, 'means what is useful to the community.' But of 
course the death of the community is not useful to the community — only the death 
of some of its members. What is really meant is that the death of some men is 
useful to other men. That is very true. But on what ground are some men being 
asked to die for the benefit of others? Every appeal to pride, honour, shame, or 
love is excluded by hypothesis. To use these would be to return to sentiment and 
the Innovator's task is, having cut all that away, to explain to men, in terms of pure 
reasoning, why they will be well advised to die that others may live. He may say 
'Unless some of us risk death all of us are certain to die.' But that will be true only 
in a Umited number of cases; and even when it is true it provokes the very 
reasonable counter question 'Why should I be one of those who take the risk?' 
At this point the Innovator may ask why, after all, selfishness should be more 
'rational' or 'intelligent' than altruism. The question is welcome. If by Reason we 
mean the process actually employed by Gaius and Titius when engaged in 
debunking (that is, the connecting by inference of propositions, ultimately derived 
from sense data, with further propositions), then the answer must be that a refusal 
to sacrifice oneself is no more rational than a consent to do so. And no less 
rational. Neither choice is rational — or irrational — at all. From propositions about 
fact alone no practical conclusion can ever be drawn. This will preserve society 
cannot lead to do this except by the mediation of society ought to be preserved. This 
will cost you your life cannot lead directly to do not do this: it can lead to it only 
through a felt desire or an acknowledged duty of self-preservation. The Innovator 
is trying to get a conclusion in the imperative mood out of premisses in the 
indicative mood: and though he continues trying to all eternity he cannot succeed, 
for the thing is impossible. We must therefore either extend the word Reason to 
include what our ancestors called Practical Reason and confess that judgements 
such as society ought to be preserved (though they can support themselves by no 
reason of the sort that Gaius and Titius demand) are not mere sentiments but are 
rationality itself; or else we must give up at once, and for ever, the attempt to find 
a core of 'rational' value behind all the sentiments we have debunked. The 
Innovator will not take the first alternative, for practical principles known to all 
men by Reason are simply the Tao which he has set out to supersede. He is more 
likely to give up the quest for a 'rational' core and to hunt for some other ground 
even more 'basic' and 'realistic'. 
This he will probably feel that he has found in Instinct. The preservation of 
society, and of the species itself, are ends that do not hang on the precarious 
thread of Reason: they are given by Instinct. That is why there is no need to argue 
against the man who does not acknowledge them. We have an instinctive urge to 
preserve our own species. That is why men ought to work for posterity. We have 
no instinctive urge to keep promises or to respect individual life: that is why 
scruples of justice and humanity — in fact the Tao — can be properly swept away 
when they conflict with our real end, the preservation of the species. That, again, 
is why the modern situation permits and demands a new sexual morahty: the old 
taboos served some real purpose in helping to preserve the species, but 
contraceptives have modified this and we can now abandon many of the taboos. 
For of course sexual desire, being instinctive, is to be gratified whenever it does 
not conflict with the preservation of the species. It looks, in fact, as if an ethics 
based on instinct will give the Innovator all he wants and nothing that he does not 
want. 
In reality we have not advanced one step. I will not insist on the point that Instinct 
is a name for we know not what (to say that migratory birds find their way by 
instinct is only to say that we do not know how migratory birds find their way), for 
I think it is here being used in a fairly definite sense, to mean an unreflective or 
spontaneous impulse widely felt by the members of a given species. In what way 
does Instinct, thus conceived, help us to find 'real' values? Is it maintained that we 
must obey Instinct, that we cannot do otherwise? But if so, why are Green Books 
and the like written? Why this stream of exhortation to drive us where we cannot 
help going? Why such praise for those who have submitted to the inevitable? Or is 
it maintained that if we do obey Instinct we shall be happy and satisfied? But the 
very question we are considering was that of facing death which (so far as the 
Innovator knows) cuts off every possible satisfaction: and if we have an instinctive 
desire for the good of posterity then this desire, by the very nature of the case, can 
never be satisfied, since its aim is achieved, if at all, when we are dead. It looks 
very much as if the Innovator would have to say not that we must obey Instinct, 
nor that it will satisfy us to do so, but that we ought to obey it.^ 
But why ought we to obey Instinct? Is there another instinct of a higher order 
directing us to do so, and a third of a still higher order directing us to obey it} — an 
infinite regress of instincts? This is presumably impossible, but nothing else will 
serve. From the statement about psychological fact 'I have an impulse to do so and 
so' we cannot by any ingenuity derive the practical principle 'I ought to obey this 
impulse'. Even if it were true that men had a spontaneous, unreflective impulse to 
sacrifice their own lives for the preservation of their fellows, it remains a quite 
separate question whether this is an impulse they should control or one they 
should indulge. For even the Innovator admits that many impulses (those which 
conflict with the preservation of the species) have to be controlled. And this 
admission surely introduces us to a yet more fundamental difficulty. 
Telling us to obey Instinct is like telling us to obey 'people'. People say different 
things: so do instincts. Our instincts are at war. If it is held that the instinct for 
preserving the species should always be obeyed at the expense of other instincts, 
whence do we derive this rule of precedence? To listen to that instinct speaking in 
its own cause and deciding it in its own favour would be rather simple-minded. 
Each instinct, if you listen to it, will claim to be gratified at the expense of all the 
rest. By the very act of listening to one rather than to others we have already 
prejudged the case. If we did not bring to the examination of our instincts a 
knowledge of their comparative dignity we could never learn it from them. And 
that knowledge cannot itself be instinctive: the judge cannot be one of the parties 
judged; or, if he is, the decision is worthless and there is no ground for placing the 
preservation of the species above self-preservation or sexual appetite. 
The idea that, without appealing to any court higher than the instincts themselves, 
we can yet find grounds for preferring one instinct above its fellows dies very hard. 
We grasp at useless words: we call it the 'basic', or 'fundamental', or 'primal', or 
'deepest' instinct. It is of no avail. Either these words conceal a value judgement 
passed upon the instinct and therefore not derivable from it, or else they merely 
record its felt intensity, the frequency of its operation and its wide distribution. If 
the former, the whole attempt to base value upon instinct has been abandoned: if 
the latter, these observations about the quantitative aspects of a psychological 
event lead to no practical conclusion. It is the old dilemma. Either the premisses 
already concealed an imperative or the conclusion remains merely in the 
indicative. 
Finally, it is worth inquiry whether there is any instinct to care for posterity or 
preserve the species. I do not discover it in myself: and yet I am a man rather 
prone to think of remote futurity — a man who can read Mr Olaf Stapledon with 
delight. Much less do I find it easy to beheve that the majority of people who have 
sat opposite me in buses or stood with me in queues feel an unreflective impulse to 
do anything at all about the species, or posterity. Only people educated in a 
particular way have ever had the idea 'posterity' before their minds at all. It is 
difficult to assign to instinct our attitude towards an object which exists only for 
reflective men. What we have by nature is an impulse to preserve our own children 
and grandchildren; an impulse which grows progressively feebler as the 
imagination looks forward and finally dies out in the 'deserts of vast futurity'. No 
parents who were guided by this instinct would dream for a moment of setting up 
the claims of their hypothetical descendants against those of the baby actually 
crowing and kicking in the room. Those of us who accept the Tao may, perhaps, 
say that they ought to do so: but that is not open to those who treat instinct as the 
source of value. As we pass from mother love to rational planning for the future we 
are passing away from the realm of instinct into that of choice and reflection: and 
if instinct is the source of value, planning for the future ought to be less 
respectable and less obligatory than the baby language and cuddling of the fondest 
mother or the most fatuous nursery anecdotes of a doting father. If we are to base 
ourselves upon instinct, these things are the substance, and care for posterity the 
shadow — the huge, flickering shadow of the nursery happiness cast upon the 
screen of the unknown future. I do not say this projection is a bad thing: but then I 
do not believe that instinct is the ground of value judgements. What is absurd is to 
claim that your care for posterity finds its justification in instinct and then flout at 
every turn the only instinct on which it could be supposed to rest, tearing the child 
almost from the breast to creche and kindergarten in the interests of progress and 
the coming race. 
The truth finally becomes apparent that neither in any operation with factual 
propositions nor in any appeal to instinct can the Innovator find the basis for a 
system of values. None of the principles he requires are to be found there: but they 
are all to be found somewhere else. 'AH within the four seas are his brothers'  
says Confucius of the Chiin-tzu, the cuor gentil or gentleman. Humani nihil a me 
alienum puto says the Stoic. 'Do as you would be done by,' says Jesus. 'Humanity is 
to be preserved,' says Locke." All the practical principles behind the Innovator's 
case for posterity, or society, or the species, are there from time immemorial in the 
Tao. But they are nowhere else. Unless you accept these without question as being 
to the world of action what axioms are to the world of theory, you can have no 
practical principles whatever. You cannot reach them as conclusions: they are 
premisses. You may, since they can give no 'reason' for themselves of a kind to 
silence Gaius and Titius, regard them as sentiments: but then you must give up 
contrasting 'real' or 'rational' value with sentimental value. All value will be 
sentimental^ and you must confess (on pain of abandoning every value) that all 
sentiment is not 'merely' subjective. You may, on the other hand, regard them as 
rational — nay as rationality itself — as things so obviously reasonable that they 
neither demand nor admit proof. But then you must allow that Reason can be 
practical, that an ought must not be dismissed because it cannot produce some is 
as its credential. If nothing is self-evident, nothing can be proved. Similarly if 
nothing is obligatory for its own sake, nothing is obligatory at all. 
To some it will appear that I have merely restored under another name what they 
always meant by basic or fundamental instinct. But much more than a choice of 
words is involved. The Innovator attacks traditional values (the Tao) in defence of 
what he at first supposes to be (in some special sense) 'rational' or 'biological' 
values. But as we have seen, all the values which he uses in attacking the Tao, and 
even claims to be substituting for it, are themselves derived from the Tao. If he 
had really started from scratch, from right outside the human tradition of value, no 
jugglery could have advanced him an inch towards the conception that a man 
should die for the community or work for posterity. If the Tao falls, all his own 
conceptions of value fall with it. Not one of them can claim any authority other 
than that of the Tao. Only by such shreds of the Tao as he has inherited is he 
enabled even to attack it. The question therefore arises what title he has to select 
bits of it for acceptance and to reject others. For if the bits he rejects have no 
authority, neither have those he retains: if what he retains is vahd, what he rejects 
is equally valid too. 
The Innovator, for example, rates high the claims of posterity. He cannot get any 
vaUd claim for posterity out of instinct or (in the modern sense) reason. He is 
really deriving our duty to posterity from the Tao; our duty to do good to all men 
is an axiom of Practical Reason, and our duty to do good to our descendants is a 
clear deduction from it. But then, in every form of the Tao which has come down 
to us, side by side with the duty to children and descendants lies the duty to 
parents and ancestors. By what right do we reject one and accept the other? Again, 
the Innovator may place economic value first. To get people fed and clothed is the 
great end, and in pursuit of its scruples about justice and good faith may be set 
aside. The Tao of course agrees with him about the importance of getting the 
people fed and clothed. Unless the Innovator were himself using the Tao he could 
never have learned of such a duty. But side by side with it in the Tao lie those 
duties of justice and good faith which he is ready to debunk. What is his warrant? 
He may be a Jingoist, a RaciaUst, an extreme nationalist, who maintains that the 
advancement of his own people is the object to which all else ought to yield. But 
no kind of factual observation and no appeal to instinct will give him a ground for 
this option. Once more, he is in fact deriving it from the Tao: a duty to our own 
kin, because they are our own kin, is a part of traditional morality. But side by side 
with it in the Tao, and limiting it, lie the inflexible demands of justice, and the rule 
that, in the long run, all men are our brothers. Whence comes the Innovator's 
authority to pick and choose? 
Since I can see no answer to these questions, I draw the following conclusions. 
This thing which I have called for convenience the Tao, and which others may call 
Natural Law or Traditional Morality or the First Principles of Practical Reason or 
the First Platitudes, is not one among a series of possible systems of value. It is the 
sole source of all value judgements. If it is rejected, all value is rejected. If any 
value is retained, it is retained. The effort to refute it and raise a new system of 
value in its place is self-contradictory. There has never been, and never will be, a 
radically new judgement of value in the history of the world. What purport to be 
new systems or (as they now call them) 'ideologies', all consist of fragments from 
the Tao itself, arbitrarily wrenched from their context in the whole and then 
swollen to madness in their isolation, yet still owing to the Tao and to it alone such 
vaUdity as they possess. If my duty to my parents is a superstition, then so is my 
duty to posterity. If justice is a superstition, then so is my duty to my country or 
my race. If the pursuit of scientific knowledge is a real value, then so is conjugal 
fidelity. The rebellion of new ideologies against the Tao is a rebellion of the 
branches against the tree: if the rebels could succeed they would find that they had 
destroyed themselves. The human mind has no more power of inventing a new 
value than of imagining a new primary colour, or, indeed, of creating a new sun 
and a new sky for it to move in. 
Does this mean, then, that no progress in our perceptions of value can ever take 
place? That we are bound down for ever to an unchanging code given once for all? 
And is it, in any event, possible to talk of obeying what I call the Tao? If we lump 
together, as I have done, the traditional moralities of East and West, the Christian, 
the Pagan, and the Jew, shall we not find many contradictions and some 
absurdities? I admit all this. Some criticism, some removal of contradictions, even 
some real development, is required. But there are two very different kinds of 
criticism. 
A theorist about language may approach his native tongue, as it were from outside, 
regarding its genius as a thing that has no claim on him and advocating wholesale 
alterations of its idiom and spelling in the interests of commercial convenience or 
scientific accuracy. That is one thing. A great poet, who has 'loved, and been well 
nurtured in, his mother tongue', may also make great alterations in it, but his 
changes of the language are made in the spirit of the language itself: he works from 
within. The language which suffers, has also inspired the changes. That is a 
different thing — as different as the works of Shakespeare are from Basic English. It 
is the difference between alteration from within and alteration from without: 
between the organic and the surgical. In the same way, the Tao admits 
development from within. There is a difference between a real moral advance and 
a mere innovation. From the Confucian 'Do not do to others what you would not 
like them to do to you' to the Christian 'Do as you would be done by' is a real 
advance. The morality of Nietzsche is a mere innovation. The first is an advance 
because no one who did not admit the vaUdity of the old maxim could see reason 
for accepting the new one, and anyone who accepted the old would at once 
recognize the new as an extension of the same principle. If he rejected it, he would 
have to reject it as a superfluity, something that went too far, not as something 
simply heterogeneous from his own ideas of value. But the Nietzschean ethic can 
be accepted only if we are ready to scrap traditional morals as a mere error and 
then to put ourselves in a position where we can find no ground for any value 
judgements at all. It is the difference between a man who says to us: 'You like your 
vegetables moderately fresh; why not grow your own and have them perfectly 
fresh?' and a man who says. Throw away that loaf and try eating bricks and 
centipedes instead.' 
Those who understand the spirit of the Tao and who have been led by that spirit 
can modify it in directions which that spirit itself demands. Only they can know 
what those directions are. The outsider knows nothing about the matter. His 
attempts at alteration, as we have seen, contradict themselves. So far from being 
able to harmonize discrepancies in its letter by penetration to its spirit, he merely 
snatches at some one precept, on which the accidents of time and place happen to 
have riveted his attention, and then rides it to death — for no reason that he can 
give. From within the Tao itself comes the only authority to modify the Tao. This 
is what Confucius meant when he said 'With those who follow a different Way it is 
useless to take counsel'. ^ This is why Aristotle said that only those who have been 
well brought up can usefully study ethics: to the corrupted man, the man who 
stands outside the Tao, the very starting point of this science is invisible.* He may 
be hostile, but he cannot be critical: he does not know what is being discussed. 
This is why it was also said 'This people that knoweth not the Law is accursed'^ 
and 'He that beheveth not shall be damned'.*^ An open mind, in questions that are 
not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ultimate foundations either of 
Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy. If a man's mind is open on these 
things, let his mouth at least be shut. He can say nothing to the purpose. Outside 
the Tao there is no ground for criticizing either the Tao or anything else. In 
particular instances it may, no doubt, be a matter of some delicacy to decide where 
the legitimate internal criticism ends and the fatal external kind begins. But 
wherever any precept of traditional morality is simply challenged to produce its 
credentials, as though the burden of proof lay on it, we have taken the wrong 
position. The legitimate reformer endeavours to show that the precept in question 
conflicts with some precept which its defenders allow to be more fundamental, or 
that it does not really embody the judgement of value it professes to embody. The 
direct frontal attack 'Why?' — 'What good does it do?' — 'Who said so?' is never 
permissible; not because it is harsh or offensive but because no values at all can 
justify themselves on that level. If you persist in that kind of trial you will destroy 
all values, and so destroy the bases of your own criticism as well as the thing 
criticized. You must not hold a pistol to the head of the Tao. Nor must we 
postpone obedience to a precept until its credentials have been examined. Only 
those who are practising the Tao will understand it. It is the well-nurtured man, 
the cuorgentil, and he alone, who can recognize Reason when it comes. ^ It is Paul, 
the Pharisee, the man 'perfect as touching the Law' who learns where and how that 
Law was deficient. '° In order to avoid misunderstanding, I may add that though I 
myself am a Theist, and indeed a Christian, I am not here attempting any indirect 
argument for Theism. I am simply arguing that if we are to have values at all we 
must accept the ultimate platitudes of Practical Reason as having absolute validity: 
that any attempt, having become sceptical about these, to reintroduce value lower 
down on some supposedly more 'realistic' basis, is doomed. Whether this position 
implies a supernatural origin for the Tao is a question I am not here concerned 
with. 
Yet how can the modern mind be expected to embrace the conclusion we have 
reached? This Tao which, it seems, we must treat as an absolute is simply a 
phenomenon like any other — the reflection upon the minds of our ancestors of the 
agricultural rhythm in which they lived or even of their physiology. We know 
already in principle how such things are produced: soon we shall know in detail: 
eventually we shall be able to produce them at will. Of course, while we did not 
know how minds were made, we accepted this mental furniture as a datum, even 
as a master. But many things in nature which were once our masters have become 
our servants. Why not this? Why must our conquest of nature stop short, in stupid 
reverence, before this final and toughest bit of 'nature' which has hitherto been 
called the conscience of man? You threaten us with some obscure disaster if we 
step outside it: but we have been threatened in that way by obscurantists at every 
step in our advance, and each time the threat has proved false. You say we shall 
have no values at all if we step outside the Tao. Very well: we shall probably find 
that we can get on quite comfortably without them. Let us regard all ideas of what 
we ought to do simply as an interesting psychological survival: let us step right out 
of all that and start doing what we like. Let us decide for ourselves what man is to 
be and make him into that: not on any ground of imagined value, but because we 
want him to be such. Having mastered our environment, let us now master 
ourselves and choose our own destiny. 
This is a very possible position: and those who hold it cannot be accused of self- 
contradiction like the half-hearted sceptics who still hope to find 'real' values when 
they have debunked the traditional ones. This is the rejection of the concept of 
value altogether. I shall need another lecture to consider it. 
ONCE there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. This story is
about something that happened to them when they were sent away from London during the war
because of the air-raids. They were sent to the house of an old Professor who lived in the heart of the
country, ten miles from the nearest railway station and two miles from the nearest post office. He had
no wife and he lived in a very large house with a housekeeper called Mrs Macready and three
servants. (Their names were Ivy, Margaret and Betty, but they do not come into the story much.) He
himself was a very old man with shaggy white hair which grew over most of his face as well as on his
head, and they liked him almost at once; but on the first evening when he came out to meet them at
the front door he was so odd-looking that Lucy (who was the youngest) was a little afraid of him, and
Edmund (who was the next youngest) wanted to laugh and had to keep on pretending he was blowing
his nose to hide it.
As soon as they had said good night to the Professor and gone upstairs on the first night, the boys
came into the girls' room and they all talked it over.
"We've fallen on our feet and no mistake," said Peter. "This is going to be perfectly splendid. That
old chap will let us do anything we like."
 "I think he's an old dear," said Susan.
"Oh, come off it!" said Edmund, who was tired and pretending not to be tired, which always made
him bad-tempered. "Don't go on talking like that."
 "Like what?" said Susan; "and anyway, it's time you were in bed."
 "Trying to talk like Mother," said Edmund. "And who are you to say when I'm to go to bed? Go to
bed yourself."
 "Hadn't we all better go to bed?" said Lucy. "There's sure to be a row if we're heard talking here."
 "No there won't," said Peter. "I tell you this is the sort of house where no one's going to mind what
we do. Anyway, they won't hear us. It's about ten minutes' walk from here down to that dining-room,
and any amount of stairs and passages in between."
 "What's that noise?" said Lucy suddenly. It was a far larger house than she had ever been in before
and the thought of all those long passages and rows of doors leading into empty rooms was beginning
to make her feel a little creepy.
"It's only a bird, silly," said Edmund.
"It's an owl," said Peter. "This is going to be a wonderful place for birds. I shall go to bed now. I
say, let's go and explore tomorrow. You might find anything in a place like this. Did you see those
mountains as we came along? And the woods? There might be eagles. There might be stags. There'll
be hawks."
 "Badgers!" said Lucy.
 "Foxes!" said Edmund.
 "Rabbits!" said Susan.
 But when next morning came there was a steady rain falling, so thick that when you looked out of
the window you could see neither the mountains nor the woods nor even the stream in the garden.
"Of course it would be raining!" said Edmund. They had just finished their breakfast with the
Professor and were upstairs in the room he had set apart for them - a long, low room with two
windows looking out in one direction and two in another.
"Do stop grumbling, Ed," said Susan. "Ten to one it'll clear up in an hour or so. And in the
meantime we're pretty well off. There's a wireless and lots of books."
 "Not for me” said Peter; "I'm going to explore in the house."
 Everyone agreed to this and that was how the adventures began. It was the sort of house that you
never seem to come to the end of, and it was full of unexpected places. The first few doors they tried
led only into spare bedrooms, as everyone had expected that they would; but soon they came to a
very long room full of pictures and there they found a suit of armour; and after that was a room all
hung with green, with a harp in one corner; and then came three steps down and five steps up, and
then a kind of little upstairs hall and a door that led out on to a balcony, and then a whole series of
rooms that led into each other and were lined with books - most of them very old books and some
bigger than a Bible in a church. And shortly after that they looked into a room that was quite empty
except for one big wardrobe; the sort that has a looking-glass in the door. There was nothing else in
the room at all except a dead blue-bottle on the window-sill.
 "Nothing there!" said Peter, and they all trooped out again - all except Lucy. She stayed behind
because she thought it would be worth while trying the door of the wardrobe, even though she felt
almost sure that it would be locked. To her surprise it opened quite easily, and two moth-balls
dropped out.
Looking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up - mostly long fur coats. There was nothing
Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She immediately stepped into the wardrobe and got
in among the coats and rubbed her face against them, leaving the door open, of course, because she
knew that it is very foolish to shut oneself into any wardrobe. Soon she went further in and found that
there was a second row of coats hanging up behind the first one. It was almost quite dark in there and
she kept her arms stretched out in front of her so as not to bump her face into the back of the
wardrobe. She took a step further in - then two or three steps always expecting to feel woodwork
against the tips of her fingers. But she could not feel it.
"This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!" thought Lucy, going still further in and pushing the
soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then she noticed that there was something
crunching under her feet. "I wonder is that more mothballs?" she thought, stooping down to feel it
with her hand. But instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she felt
something soft and powdery and extremely cold. "This is very queer," she said, and went on a step or
two further.
Next moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no longer soft fur but
something hard and rough and even prickly. "Why, it is just like branches of trees!" exclaimed Lucy.
And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the
wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on her. A
moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under 
her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.
Lucy felt a little frightened, but she felt very inquisitive and excited as well. She looked back over
her shoulder and there, between the dark tree trunks; she could still see the open doorway of the
wardrobe and even catch a glimpse of the empty room from which she had set out. (She had, of
course, left the door open, for she knew that it is a very silly thing to shut oneself into a wardrobe.) It
seemed to be still daylight there. "I can always get back if anything goes wrong," thought Lucy. She
began to walk forward, crunch-crunch over the snow and through the wood towards the other light. In
about ten minutes she reached it and found it was a lamp-post. As she stood looking at it, wondering
why there was a lamp-post in the middle of a wood and wondering what to do next, she heard a pitter
patter of feet coming towards her. And soon after that a very strange person stepped out from among
the trees into the light of the lamp-post.
He was only a little taller than Lucy herself and he carried over his head an umbrella, white with
snow. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were shaped like a goat's (the hair on
them was glossy black) and instead of feet he had goat's hoofs. He also had a tail, but Lucy did not
notice this at first because it was neatly caught up over the arm that held the umbrella so as to keep it
from trailing in the snow. He had a red woollen muffler round his neck and his skin was rather
reddish too. He had a strange, but pleasant little face, with a short pointed beard and curly hair, and
out of the hair there stuck two horns, one on each side of his forehead. One of his hands, as I have
said, held the umbrella: in the other arm he carried several brown-paper parcels. What with the
parcels and the snow it looked just as if he had been doing his Christmas shopping. He was a Faun.
And when he saw Lucy he gave such a start of surprise that he dropped all his parcels.
"Goodness gracious me!" exclaimed the Faun.
 "GOOD EVENING," said Lucy. But the Faun was so busy picking up its parcels that at first it did
not reply. When it had finished it made her a little bow.
"Good evening, good evening," said the Faun. "Excuse me - I don't want to be inquisitive - but
should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve?"
 "My name's Lucy," said she, not quite understanding him.
"But you are - forgive me - you are what they call a girl?" said the Faun.
"Of course I'm a girl," said Lucy.
"You are in fact Human?"
 "Of course I'm human," said Lucy, still a little puzzled.
"To be sure, to be sure," said the Faun. "How stupid of me! But I've never seen a Son of Adam or a
Daughter of Eve before. I am delighted. That is to say -" and then it stopped as if it had been going to
say something it had not intended but had remembered in time. "Delighted, delighted," it went on.
"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tumnus."
 "I am very pleased to meet you, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy.
"And may I ask, O Lucy Daughter of Eve," said Mr Tumnus, "how you have come into Narnia?"
 "Narnia? What's that?" said Lucy.
"This is the land of Narnia," said the Faun, "where we are now; all that lies between the lamp-post
and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea. And you - you have come from the wild woods
of the west?"
 "I - I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room," said Lucy.
"Ah!" said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, "if only I had worked harder at geography
when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strange countries. It is too late now."
 "But they aren't countries at all," said Lucy, almost laughing. "It's only just back there - at least - I'm
not sure. It is summer there."
 "Meanwhile," said Mr Tumnus, "it is winter in Narnia, and has been for ever so long, and we shall
both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow. Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom
where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe, how would it be if you came and
had tea with me?"
 "Thank you very much, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy. "But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting
back."
 "It's only just round the corner," said the Faun, "and there'll be a roaring fire - and toast - and
sardines - and cake."
 "Well, it's very kind of you," said Lucy. "But I shan't be able to stay long."
 "If you will take my arm, Daughter of Eve," said Mr Tumnus, "I shall be able to hold the umbrella
over both of us. That's the way. Now - off we go."
 And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature as if they
had known one another all their lives.
They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were
rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. At the bottom of one small valley Mr Tumnus
turned suddenly aside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at the last
moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave. As soon as they were inside she
found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire. Then Mr Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece
of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp. "Now we shan't be long," he
said, and immediately put a kettle on.
Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, clean cave of reddish stone
with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs ("one for me and one for a friend," said Mr Tumnus)
and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with
a grey beard. In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr Tumnus's bedroom,
and on one wall was a shelf full of books. Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea
things. They had titles like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men,
Monks and Gamekeepers; a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth?
 "Now, Daughter of Eve!" said the Faun.
And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and
then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped
cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of life
in the forest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the
Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the
milk-white stag who could give you wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking
with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about
summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and
sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the
whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end. "Not that it isn't always winter
now," he added gloomily. Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange
little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he played made
Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time. It must have been hours
later when she shook herself and said:
 "Oh, Mr Tumnus - I'm so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune - but really, I must go home. I
only meant to stay for a few minutes."
 "It's no good now, you know," said the Faun, laying down its flute and shaking its head at her very
sorrowfully.
"No good?" said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. "What do you mean? I've got to go
home at once. The others will be wondering what has happened to me." But a moment later she
asked, "Mr Tumnus! Whatever is the matter?" for the Faun's brown eyes had filled with tears and
then the tears began trickling down its cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of its nose; and
at last it covered its face with its hands and began to howl.
"Mr Tumnus! Mr Tumnus!" said Lucy in great distress. "Don't! Don't! What is the matter? Aren'
you well? Dear Mr Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong." But the Faun continued sobbing as if its heart
would break. And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her hand
kerchief, he did not stop. He merely took the handker chief and kept on using it, wringing it out with
both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a
damp patch.
"Mr Tumnus!" bawled Lucy in his ear, shaking him. "Do stop. Stop it at once! You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, a great big Faun like you. What on earth are you crying about?"
 "Oh - oh - oh!" sobbed Mr Tumnus, "I'm crying because I'm such a bad Faun."
 "I don't think you're a bad Faun at all," said Lucy. "I think you are a very good Faun. You are the
nicest Faun I've ever met."
 "Oh - oh - you wouldn't say that if you knew," replied Mr Tumnus between his sobs. "No, I'm a bad
Faun. I don't suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world."
 "But what have you done?" asked Lucy.
"My old father, now," said Mr Tumnus; "that's his picture over the mantelpiece. He would never
have done a thing like this."
 "A thing like what?" said Lucy.
"Like what I've done," said the Faun. "Taken service under the White Witch. That's what I am. I'm
in the pay of the White Witch."
 "The White Witch? Who is she?"
 "Why, it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb. It's she that makes it always winter. Always
winter and never Christmas; think of that!"
 "How awful!" said Lucy. "But what does she pay you for?"
 "That's the worst of it," said Mr Tumnus with a deep groan. "I'm a kidnapper for her, that's what I
am. Look at me, Daughter of Eve. Would you believe that I'm the sort of Faun to meet a poor
innocent child in the wood, one that had never done me any harm, and pretend to be friendly with it,
and invite it home to my cave, all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the
White Witch?"
 "No," said Lucy. "I'm sure you wouldn't do anything of the sort."
 "But I have," said the Faun.
"Well," said Lucy rather slowly (for she wanted to be truthful and yet not be too hard on him),
"well, that was pretty bad. But you're so sorry for it that I'm sure you will never do it again."
 "Daughter of Eve, don't you understand?" said the Faun. "It isn't something I have done. I'm doing it
now, this very moment."
 "What do you mean?" cried Lucy, turning very white.
"You are the child," said Tumnus. "I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of
Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood, I was to catch them and hand them over to her. And you are
the first I've ever met. And I've pretended to be your friend an asked you to tea, and all the time I've
been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell Her."
 "Oh, but you won't, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy. "Yo won't, will you? Indeed, indeed you really
mustn't."
 "And if I don't," said he, beginning to cry again "she's sure to find out. And she'll have my tail cut off
and my horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out, and she'll wave her wand over my beautiful clove
hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like wretched horse's. And if she is extra and specially
angry she'll turn me into stone and I shall be only statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four
thrones at Cair Paravel are filled and goodness knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever
happen at all."
 "I'm very sorry, Mr Tumnus," said Lucy. "But please let me go home."
 "Of course I will," said the Faun. "Of course I've got to. I see that now. I hadn't known what Humans
were like before I met you. Of course I can't give you up to the Witch; not now that I know you. But
we must be off at once. I'll see you back to the lamp-post. I suppose you can find your own way from
there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe?"
 "I'm sure I can," said Lucy.
"We must go as quietly as we can," said Mr Tumnus. "The whole wood is full of her spies. Even
some of the trees are on her side."
 They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr Tumnus once more put up his umbrella
and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out into the snow. The journey back was not at all like the
journey to the Faun's cave; they stole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word, and
Mr Tumnus kept to the darkest places. Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp-post again.
"Do you know your way from here, Daughter o Eve?" said Tumnus.
Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that
looked like daylight. "Yes," she said, "I can see the wardrobe door."
 "Then be off home as quick as you can," said the Faun, "and - c-can you ever forgive me for what
meant to do?"
 "Why, of course I can," said Lucy, shaking him heartily by the hand. "And I do hope you won't get
into dreadful trouble on my account."
 "Farewell, Daughter of Eve," said he. "Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief?"
 "Rather!" said Lucy, and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would
carry her. And presently instead of rough branch brushing past her she felt coats, and instead of
crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden board and all at once she found herself jumping out of
the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started. She shut the
wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around, panting for breath. It was still raining and she
could hear the voices of the others in the passage.
"I'm here," she shouted. "I'm here. I've come back I'm all right."
 Lucy ran out of the empty room into the passage and found the other three.
"It's all right," she repeated, "I've comeback."
 "What on earth are you talking about, Lucy?" asked Susan.
"Why? said Lucy in amazement, "haven't you all been wondering where I was?"
 "So you've been hiding, have you?" said Peter. "Poor old Lu, hiding and nobody noticed! You'll have
to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you."
 "But I've been away for hours and hours," said Lucy.
The others all stared at one another.
"Batty!" said Edmund, tapping his head. "Quite batty."
 "What do you mean, Lu?" asked Peter.
"What I said," answered Lucy. "It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe, and I've
been away for hours and hours, and had tea, and all sorts of things have happened."
 "Don't be silly, Lucy," said Susan. "We've only just come out of that room a moment ago, and you
were there then."
 "She's not being silly at all," said Peter, "she's just making up a story for fun, aren't you, Lu? And
why shouldn't she?"
 "No, Peter, I'm not," she said. "It's - it's a magic wardrobe. There's a wood inside it, and it's snowing,
and there's a Faun and a Witch and it's called Narnia; come and see."
 The others did not know what to think, but Lucy was so excited that they all went back with her into
the room. She rushed ahead of them, flung open the door of the wardrobe and cried, "Now! go in and
see for yourselves."
 "Why, you goose," said Susan, putting her head inside and pulling the fur coats apart, "it's just an
ordinary wardrobe; look! there's the back of it."
 Then everyone looked in and pulled the coats apart; and they all saw - Lucy herself saw - a perfectly
ordinary wardrobe. There was no wood and no snow, only the back of the wardrobe, with hooks on it.
Peter went in and rapped his knuckles on it to make sure that it was solid.
"A jolly good hoax, Lu," he said as he came out again; "you have really taken us in, I must admit.
We half believed you."
 "But it wasn't a hoax at all," said Lucy, "really and truly. It was all different a moment ago. Honestly
it was. I promise."
 "Come, Lu," said Peter, "that's going a bit far. You've had your joke. Hadn't you better drop it now?"
 Lucy grew very red in the face and tried to say something, though she hardly knew what she was
trying to say, and burst into tears.
For the next few days she was very miserable. She could have made it up with the others quite
easily at any moment if she could have brought herself to say that the whole thing was only a story
made up for fun. But Lucy was a very truthful girl and she knew that she was really in the right; and
she could not bring herself to say this. The others who thought she was telling a lie, and a silly lie too,
made her very unhappy. The two elder ones did this without meaning to do it, but Edmund could be
spiteful, and on this occasion he was spiteful. He sneered and jeered at Lucy and kept on asking her if
she'd found any other new countries in other cupboards all over the house. What made it worse was
that these days ought to have been delightful. The weather was fine and they were out of doors from
morning to night, bathing, fishing, climbing trees, and lying in the heather. But Lucy could not
properly enjoy any of it. And so things went on until the next wet day.
That day, when it came to the afternoon and there was still no sign of a break in the weather, they
decided to play hide-and-seek. Susan was "It" and as soon as the others scattered to hide, Lucy went
to the room where the wardrobe was. She did not mean to hide in the wardrobe, because she knew
